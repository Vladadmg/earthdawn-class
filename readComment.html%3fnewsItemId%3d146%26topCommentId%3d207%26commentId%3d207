<br>3 November 2003</font></td><td width="80%"><font><b>So what went wrong with the original Earthdawn? revisited!</b>
<br>
<p>Wow! Alot of great responses! I realize that it is kind of awkward to critizie a game on it's own revival site. Well, no real flames so far. Thank you all. As to my own personal taste, it was just a run up to the main gist of the message, which was directed to RedBrick themselves. So let's leave my taste out of it. <p></p>The main gist, and I quote myself: "who will buy these sourcebooks, the total being worth something like a smaller car? Is there truly a market for it? Is it all really that good? Is all the material really useful? Publish new books with a concentrated material instead of just rehashing the old stuff."<p></p>The old material is all out there. Except the really good stuff which might have sold out (but this should be reprinted). 95% of the textmass in the products are just that, text. Even if RedBrick plans a major overhaul of the rulessystem, there will still only be very little material that really needs reprinting.<p></p>I am talking economics here. Does anyone here have any idea of how mindboggling expensive it is to put out all these books? As the title of the original post asks: why did ED fail in the first place? For those who didn't get it: Too much crap, too few gems. Too many books on the market (=huge investment), diluted sales (=low returns). It just doesn't make sense. There is also the time perspective! How long does a game "survive on the market"? How long does RedBrick have to market and sell all those books and supplements before the market looses interest in Earthdawn Classic?  Could it be 2 years? 4 years? 6 years? Even the really long running systems (like Shadowrun, Star Wars, MERP) didn't last that long. AD&amp;D 3.5 ED is quite a long way gone from D&amp;D. A short time span requires a larger density of books which risks either outrunning the fans (the last third of the books arrives as the first third of the buyers looses interest in the game/hobby) or swamping them (2 books a month? How much money does people actually have to spend on RPG books?).<p></p>Also, finally, it has been proven without a doubt that Earthdawn already failed on the open market (on both the English and Japanese language markets for that matter!). The challange that faces RedBrick is to find out why it failed and fix the problem. I have, in the original post given my reason as to why ED failed in the first attempt, I'll restate them:<p></p>1. FASA put out books full of useless stuff, resulting in a low value per book ratio, thus scaring of buyers. <p></p>Personal example: I bought the first two adventures, and then never bought an adventure again, as they were fairly useless to me. Out of the excellent Thera supplement, a gem, I could only use about one quarter of the text. I never even bothere buying the supplements that came after, although I like Cara Fadh (it was to peripheral and the material I already had was good enough for my own campaigns).<p></p>If this wasn't true, then why didn't more people buy all the books? The ideal ratio should be 1 copy of every supplement for every rule book sold. What was the original ED up to? 1:5? 1:10? Does anyone have any un-classified figures?<p></p>2. FASA put out too many books, resulting in making products that competed with other products in the same genre! This is fine if we are talking McDonalds (it is, or was, their strategy) but in an investement intesive business as the one FASA was in, it is economic suicide. For people who doubt me, take a look at how the mobile phone industry works. The cell phones that I have here in Japan are 2 years ahead of the "state of the art" phones released in the States/Europe.<p></p>Personal example: Let me see, of the 2 magic supplements, do I really need to buy any of them? Or is it safe to stick with the magic rules (that work beautifully, and that I haven't even explored fully yet) already in the rulebook?<p></p>If this wasn't true, what are all those unsold ED books doing in the warehouse? (this sounds funny when I read it over again, but think of it: a company does not want to produce too many copies of anything, if they did their planning, they would know the sell rate (or at least be able to make an estimate that is 90% accurate) and thus not produce too many books!)<p></p>The sum of it all, if anyone is still reading this is:<p></p>1. RedBrick needs to find out why the original ED failed and address those failures (be they poor planning, poor marketing, poor products or whatever) with a realistic plan.<p></p>And hence,<p></p>It is my oppinion that RedBrick falls right into the trap of the old ED. Too many books, too low quality over all.<p></p>So, my suggestion to RedBrick is: Republish only the REALLY good stuff, and do it fairly quickly. This to capture a new generation of players. Use massive marketing to punch a hole in the wet blanket that is D20. Write NEW stuff that is at least as good as the stuff you have just republished. This is to get the old fans back. <p></p>Quite frankly, at my present company (doing product development) I would be fired for even suggesting a market plan such as the one just made public for Earthdawn Classic. 25 old fans on a forum is not going to be of any help, at all.<p></p>And finally 1, yes, I love Earthdawn, why else would I be here? And finally 2, may I recommend cheap ass Chinese printing? Cool paper and binding, vivid colours, cheap distribution and low low prices!<p></p>In replying to this, please limit your comments to the meaty parts of this post. There's no need to "attack my love of ED", or accuse me of being grumpy. I would love RedBrick to come with a reply starting... <p></p>"Yes! We have already discussed ALL of the things that you mention, and here is what we are going to do about it (we just didn't want to make our strategy public until now):"<p></p>Yours, R, Tokyo.</p>

<br>
<p>I have to agree with the friend from Japan.<br>I also ADORE Earthdawn, but I am not enough for it to succeed (neither the 25 old fans in the forum as robertsvard said).<br>The market here in Greece (well, I am from Greece and it is the only market I know and I can speak of) has become very difficult. Book prices are extremely high, for example the new Dragonlance book costs 50 Euro. The average salary in Greece is about 800 Euros/month... You can easily understand what sacrifices a RPG-maniac has to take in order to get what he wants. Another fact to take care of is that I believe Earthdawn is a game not known to many. I would say that FASA didn't spend much money or time in advertisment. Ask 30 gamers (in Greece of course) about ED, only one will have heard of it.<br>My advice to you : Reprint some of the old books in tomes (3 books to 1 hardcover) and make a selection of the "gems" robertsvard said about. Take opinions from as many old ED fans as you can. Advertise your stuff in RPG sites, shops, markets. Learn first what the market needs and how you can provide it.<br>We will be here in every step, helping as best as we can. This game you trying to sell is something we love and we want to buy, as long as it worths it.<p></p>Byron<p></p>P.S Sorry for any mistakes, my English are not that good... well I guess neither are your Greek :)</p>

<br>
<p>"R" (Robert?)<p></p>I'll attempt to respond to your posting as follows, although I come away from reading your posts with the very clear picture that we aren't going to producing anything that you are going to be interested in purchasing...<p></p>Caveat: Please do take the time to read my entire response before you pre-judge my reaction to your posting.<p></p>Firstly, in *my* response to your original posting (I can't speak for other people), I did ask for some *constructive* feedback. I don't believe that you have actually provided anything "constructive" at all to date, particularly with this post, which simply seems to be a rehash of your original post.<p></p>You have made it very clear that you: a) seem happy with the game rules as they stand; b) don't really seem enamoured of the supplements and sourcebooks to date (since you don't like most of the "fluff" and possibly want more "crunch"?); c) don't seems to like the adventures that much. *shrug* I reiterate, this is all entirely YOUR opinion. And you are very welcome to express it. I think you've expressed it enough now, though.<p></p>My response to your other comments (interested readers, please reference these back to the original posting). My apologies in advance if I don't cover all of these in detail:<p></p>"Who will buy these sourcebooks?" I think a lot of Earthdawn gamers will. I think that you won't, since they will "probably" contain a similar content makeup. Whether they do follow the FASA format is in part based on feedback from Earthdawn gamers. I am taking your vote as a "No".<p></p>"Is there truly a market for it?" From the response we've had to date? Absolutely.<p></p>"Is all the material really useful?" The usefulness of the material will vary from gamer to gamer. If it ends up following the FASA format because that is what the gamers who provide us with specific feedback say they want, then I suspect you won't be purchasing much of our material. Otherwise, if the format changes and aligns itself "by concensus" to something that is closer to what you yourself may want, then you might.<p></p>"Publish new books with a concentrated material instead of just rehashing the old stuff." We're not planning to simply "rehash the old stuff" any more than we need to. And from our perspective, that means getting as much information into the rulebooks (i.e. rules), into the sourcebooks (i.e. source information), etc., as possible. The new supplements and sourcebooks are intended to be primarily *new* -- if there's any existing information on some of the topics covered by these, then it will be re-used. How much of a mix that results in (old to new) will vary, but I doubt there will be worse than a 50/50 mix in even the extreme cases.<p></p>"Does anyone here have any idea of how mindboggling expensive it is to put out all these books?" Yes, we do. Otherwise we wouldn't have pursued this property in the first place. I'm not sure you do? Nothing you have said to this point gives me the impression you are qualified to talk about producing roleplaying games?<p></p>"Why did ED fail in the first place?" It failed for many reasons. You do raise some interesting questions in this paragraph. Thanks for that. I'm not sure that your're talking about just Earthdawn or whether your comments couldn't apply to almost any roleplaying game line? The fact of the matter is that Earthdawn *has* survived for a very long time. We've taken into account the relative size of our market in our business plan. And we've still decided to continue. That's all I have to say on this matter.<p></p>"The challange that faces RedBrick is to find out why it failed and fix the problem." Ah, *now* you're getting my interest. But all you've really done is expressed an opinion on why YOU think the game line failed. Admittedly, I would like to think that this is an opinion shared by your fellow gamers, so I can't exclude it completely out-of-hand as being invalid. But it is still only an opinion. The only way you would find out why the game line was "unsuccessful" would be to get an answer from FASA. And I can't answer for them.<p></p>Now, here's some homework for you. Send me an email with a detailed breakdown of exactly why you think the game line failed, point by point. Include any numbers or statistics you have to back up your allegations. Cold hard facts please. Because everything I've read to date -- statistics and numbers shw that the game line was actually very successful? Whether we can turn the current trend around and resurrect that potential will simply be a test of our business plan and time.<p></p>Moving on...<p></p>"1. FASA put out books full of useless stuff, resulting in a low value per book ratio, thus scaring of buyers... If this wasn't true, then why didn't more people buy all the books? " Ah. Now you lost my interest again. I think this is your opinion showing again. Joy! My interest is back! I'm curious as to how you qualify your ratios though? Can you back these up with fact? Can you compare this ratio with, say, a popular game line like WW's Exalted? AEG's 7th Sea? DP9's Tribe 8? Even WotC's Dungeons and Dragons?<p></p>"2. FASA put out too many books, resulting in making products that competed with other products in the same genre!" Maybe. Again, in your opinion. My opinion? I don't think they put enough books out. I qualify that by saying that, for instance: "My campaign draws extensively on the background materials produced by FASA. There are a number of areas that my players have begun exploring that I don't have a clear vision of, for example, Rugaria. While I am currently creating my own campaign material for use in this area, I find that my time is limited and I would have liked it if FASA had done more with this province." Hmmm... That's still a bit opinionistic. My real reasons are (another example): "I have less time these days to develop Earthdawn campaign material, therefore I would appreciate it if FASA or whoever creates and publishes more Earthdawn material on these areas: Rugaria, Vasgothia, wherever. I would really like it if any new sourcebooks contained a more detailed history and timeline, particularly of events following the end of the Scourge and leading up to ABC. Also, can you please include more detailed maps of the area? There weren't enough maps in the original supplements and that would save me a lot of time. More creatures would be useful as well. Etc..." Of course, if you aren't interested in using the Fourth World, then very little of this material is going to be useful anyway. *shrugs*<p></p>More homework. Drop me an email and give me your ideas on what you would like to see from the supplements given in RedBrick's Publication Roster. Be as specific as you can. Step outside the bubble and pretend that you design games for a living and you are looking at producing supplements for a passionate fan community. Consider that you want to try and grow the market. Now, take a deep breath and let us know what *you* would like to see.<p></p>Moving on...<p></p>"What are all those unsold ED books doing in the warehouse?" I don't know. Perhaps FASA over-estimated the market when they did their print volume calculations? Perhaps there was a really good price break at 10000 copies that made it cheaper compared to 5000? It's a big mystery really... *grin* I think the question you want to ask here is "Is RedBrick going to do this as well? Because that would be crazy!" And the answer is: "No. RedBrick is not going to go and print thousands of copies of supplements in order to help feed the silverfish population and assist with the deforestation of the planet." Or just: "No." We are not over-estimating our market and our sell rate. Conversely, we are not "under-estimating" our market either. That would be a more heinous crime, IMO.<p></p>"1. RedBrick needs to find out why the original ED failed and address those failures (be they poor planning, poor marketing, poor products or whatever) with a realistic plan." We have a realistic plan.<p></p>"It is my oppinion that RedBrick falls right into the trap of the old ED. Too many books, too low quality over all." I don't think you can say this based on your comments to date. Particularly the quality comment. That's way off the target. I'll comment on why I think this is the case further down.<p></p>"Republish only the REALLY good stuff, and do it fairly quickly." What we think is the material worth republishing is already in the pipeline. Whether it's the REALLY good stuff will be determined by the market.<p></p>"Use massive marketing to punch a hole in the wet blanket that is D20." We have a marketing budget. I wouldn't call it a massive marketing budget. Are you offering to bankroll our marketing campaign, though? *smile* And I wouldn't even deem to call d20 a wet blanket.<p></p>"Write NEW stuff that is at least as good as the stuff you have just republished. This is to get the old fans back." Hmm. This seems contradictory to me. Well, the republished stuff will be mainly FASA stuff. And I got the impression that you weren't that keen on most of the FASA stuff. Oh, I get it! *penny drops* You mean write NEW material that is at least as good as the REALLY good stuff? OK. We're going to try VERY hard to do exactly that. *smile*<p></p>Whether it meets your standards? Well, see the previous homework exercise and add another entry: please provide us with some examples of what you deem to be REALLY good stuff so that we can avoid the REALLY bad stuff.<p></p>"I would be fired for even suggesting a market plan such as the one just made public for Earthdawn Classic." What marketing plan? We haven't posted up our marketing plan? Did I miss something? We have posted an INDICATION of what RedBrick is thinking of producing by way of products. This is based on feedback from the Earthdawn community and, while it looks like a lot of books, it might not end up being anyehere the number presented. Interestingly enough, our first releases aren't even shown on the roster. What this is intended to do is to engender some feedback and debate. And offline, through email, it has done this. But people will be invited to provide suggestions on what they do or don't want to see "on the roster" and the "order of preference" they would like. But it's NOT a marketing plan. Perhaps I should modify the document to make that clearer? Hmmmmm... As for our REAL "marketing plan" -- we may share that in time. We are hoping to share some of our business experiences with the world in order to provide gamers with an idea of what REALLY goes on behind the scenes.<p></p>In answer to the previous "too low quality overall?", I am surprised that you could even make this comment? Particularly considering we haven't released anything yet... If you are basing your comment on the INDICATIVE Publications Roster, then you've done a lot of reading between the lines. Can you please be more specific? I've had nothing but positive response from the "draft" material we have put together to date.<p></p>"25 old fans on a forum is not going to be of any help, at all." I'm not sure where this comment comes from? There's a lot more Earthdawn gamers out there? Unless you are referring to the number of gamers who have provided you with feedback to date? I'm confused...<p></p>Moving on...<p></p>"I love Earthdawn, why else would I be here?" Something we ABSOLUTELY both agree on Robert! *grin* Why else would I risk a lot of money, the love of my family, and all of my unallocated time for the forseeable future doing this? And the same can be said for those who been working with us on this project for the last year (well, almost a year) to get us to this point.<p></p>"May I recommend cheap ass Chinese printing?" And a good suggestion Robert. We've already considered using out-of-country printers. If you can provide us (email please) with some contacts, we would be happy to ask for quotes. Quality is VERY important to us, however.<p></p>"In replying to this, please limit your comments to the meaty parts of this post. There's no need to "attack my love of ED", or accuse me of being grumpy." I didn't attack you in your previous post. I can't say the same of others... I may, however, come across as somewhat scathing or critical with my responses here to your latest missive. Those who know me, even those I've met in the last few weeks, will know that I am passionate about Earthdawn. And RedBrick, the collective staff and support team, are passionate about making this a success.<p></p>"Yes! We have already discussed ALL of the things that you mention, and here is what we are going to do about it (we just didn't want to make our strategy public until now)." OK then: Yes! We have already discussed (almost) ALL of the things that you mention, plus many more as well that you haven't. As for making our strategy public? Not yet. Way too early for that. Please be patient... All things in time.<p></p>Finally from me, I've seen a lot of comments from roleplayers over the years saying "Oh, I could do a better job" or "I could just setup a publishing company and make really good roleplaying games" and so on. But the difference between "saying it" and "doing it" is vast. Well, RedBrick is doing it. And we're carrying the risk for you. And we're actually interested in what you, our "current" customers have to say, because we think you have a lot to contribute. But it is going to take time to put those mechanisms in place and, in the meantime, we're not sitting around twiddling our thumbs waiting -- we're wanting to get some products out the door as quickly as we can so that you (the customer) can decide whether we are doing the right thing by you (the customer). There's nothing novel or new about this idea. We like it and want to try it out. We are probably going to make some decisions that some people are not going to be happy with (you can't please everyone). Only time will tell if it works or not. But we intend to be as flexible as we can when it comes to creating material for the Earthdawn game line.<p></p>Robert, if you are interested in responding IN DETAIL, WITH SPECIFICS to this posting, please do me the courtesy of emailing it to me to the address on the Contact Us page. I welcome a detailed dialogue with you, but I suspect we're going to continue a serious debate/counter-debate in this forum and it's not really the place for it. If there are any points in our future discussions that you feel should be made public, then I am happy to post those up for comments and review.<p></p>What I don't to happen is for this forum to be used for personal attacks of any kind -- against posters, against the game, and against us (although I have broad shoulders). This will also keep the amount of time I have to spend replying at length to these sorts of posts (and this is not the only place I've had to do that) to a minimum. The return on that is I can actually do some work on producing quality products for the Earthdawn game line. *grin* That I think you will agree is the ultimate goal...<p></p>Again, thank you for taking the time to post your well-intentioned comments.<p></p>Kind regards,<p></p>JAMES FLOWERS<br>Line Developer, RedBrick Limited</p>

<p>I'm going to respond to a couple of points in this discussion that seem to me to be off-base. Of course, since this post is essentially saying that I did a terrible job in guiding the ED line at FASA, I should probably stay out of this, but I'll try to keep my comments (mostly) civil.<p></p>==== Begin Quote ====<br>Also, finally, it has been proven without a doubt that Earthdawn already failed on the open market (on both the English and Japanese language markets for that matter!).<br>==== End Quote ====<p></p>I disagree that this has been proven without a doubt, especially since we see LRG continuing to publish ED material. <p></p>

To say that the game failed because it's supplement sales didn't match the rulebook sales is just plain wrong.<p></p>As for ratios, I know that FASA sold roughly 40,000 - 45,000 copies of the ED rulebook, and the highest selling supplements probably sold only half that.<p></p>==== Begin Quote ====<br>2.

In fact, during the last two years that FASA published ED, we published only 4 books per year. That's hardly too many.<p></p>Of course FASA produced books that competed with other products in the same genre. How would you suggest a company produce products for a FANTASY RPG that DOESN'T complete with other fantasy RPGs? Again, your comments tell me that you know next to nothing about the game industry. All they say is that you have an narrow vision of what you like in RPGs and that ED doesn't fit your tastes.<p></p>Take Care,<p></p>Lou Prosperi<br>Former ED Line Developer</p>

<p>Dear Lou, what have I done to deserve a reply from you? I love Earthdawn. It is my favourite Fantasy game. I have almost all the products. You are right, I do know next to nothing about publishing role playing games. You are right, most of my comments are really really personal reflections. <p></p>What I wanted to do with this post is not to attack RedBrick, I will be the first to stand in line to pick up their new products. Neither did I want to attack FASA (as my favourite game overall is Shadowrun, and my second favourite game is Earthdawn, FASA has provided me with well over 50% of my greatest gaming experiences). <p></p>I voiced my fears about RedBrick perhaps not being able to carry out their plans succesfully, for reasons I've mentioned earlier. I do, really, really, hope that Earthdawn will live long and prosper and make all of the great people at RedBrick richer than Croesus.<p></p>However, in my narrow ways of expressing myself (i.e. looking like an attack rather than "I'm scared! Tell me you will carry this one through!") I have obviously managed to anger a few people. So I will offer my sincere apologies and step back, retracting all my comments and do just what was asked of me: "Wait and see". <p></p>Sorry RedBrick, and good luck.<br>Sorry Mr. Prosperi, and thanks for all the hard work you have given us during the years, succesfully bringing out a game that has given many people a lot of joy. <p></p>The one thing that I know with 100% surety about the Role Playing Games Industry is that it is not a walk in the park.<p></p>As for all the innocent bystanders caught in this cross-fire, sorry.<p></p>Yours, Robert, Tokyo.</p>

<p>Hi all,<p></p>Just for the record, I have replied to Robert offline. I don't think anyone was (badly) offended here. Just a few "gahads" got rankled... Welcome to the passionate side of Earthdawn! *grin*<p></p>Anyway, I still want to stress that we are interested in constructive debate, positive or concerned. And we look forward to some detailed contributions from you in the future Robert!<p></p>Now, back to the grindstone. *smile*<p></p>Take care,<p></p>JAMES FLOWERS<br>Line Developer, RedBrick Limited</p>

<p>Robert,<p></p>Please let me apologize for my comments. I should know better than to react this way. I didn't really mean to come down on you so hard, but your comments struck me as fairly insulting and sometimes I let my passions rule over my reason. Once again, I'm sorry.<p></p>Like you, I would like to see RedBrick succeed.<p></p>Take Care,<p></p>Lou Prosperi</p>

<p>Hello:<p></p>I think this thread alone can be a good example of what is needed to keep Earthdawn going...constructive criticism, and good alternatives.<p></p>Everyone has their beefs about any random gaming system. Being able to back them up with hard numbers, concrete examples, or even reasonable suggestions/options is better than a supersized screed that basically says "Um, it sucked before, and you'll make it suck now..."<p></p>This is why I'm not interested in the chat about this that's happening on other RPG sites, becuase those people are complaining there, and not getting themselves HERE, and offering to help.<p></p>If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem! No, everyone won't always be happy with what gets put out for an RPG...but there are duaris of what people want, and damn clear examples of what worked, and what sold.<p></p>I hope people voice concerns/issues/thoughts that can help Redbrick, and I hope they contribute to making it better and not just sitting around complaining before/during/after the fact.<p></p>It's rare in the commercial world to be able to get in on the ground floor (maybe we should call this the mezzanine) of something, and help to make it "good". <p></p>Now's your chance, everyone.</p>

<p>Well it has been ten years now that Earthdawn has been a part of my life.  I still have my first printing, beat to hell and back, taped and crippled hardcover of the rulebook (it has been through alot of abuse).  <p></p>Eitherway I love the game, loved the products produced for it initially by FASA then LRG, and am sure I will be buying stuff from you guys.  I won't even speculate why FASA dropped Earthdawn, I was not there so anything I could say would be conjecture not fact.  My opinion however on what you are doing is simple.  RedBrick is involving it's existing customer base heavily in the process of marketing this game we all love.  <p></p>One thing has struck me over the 25 years I have been gaming or gm-ing, a game is rarely successful because of the amount of advertising dollars.  What pushes most games from obscurity to success is word of mouth.  I have had amazing success with getting people to play ED over the years because these gamers value my opinion more than a full color add, or popup on a website.  If RedBrick continues to involve its customer base it will find it difficult to fail.</p>

<p>Kerym, I couldn't agree more. It's people who play the game and love the game getting out there and talking to people that will cause the fanbase to grow. Advertising IS necessary to some extent to get the name in front of people, but very few gamers are going to go spend money based on an advert in a magazine or a poster in a gaming store. <p></p>If you love the game and want to see it grow. TALK about it. Run demos at gaming conventions and stores in your area. It's a grassroots kind of thing.</p>

<p>Hi there :)<p></p>I can&Acirc;&acute;t tell you how happy i am that earthdwan is being resurrected!!!<p></p>I started playing earthdawn with the 3 flyers that came out  &Acirc;&acute;91 or so.<br>And i was really sad when i heard that fasa finished the earthdawn line just before the release of the dragons handbook.<p></p>I own every book. Even the LR-Games Earthdawn 2nd. ED line.<p></p>Right now we are playing exalted but now that i know that ED is much better supported i can&Acirc;&acute;t wait to start a new ED group :)<p></p>And i have to admid that i am really looking forward to spend every penny (here in europe it&Acirc;&acute;s cent) for any new Earthdawnbook!!!<p></p>Guys u made me really happy :)<p></p>Good Luck !!!<p></p>(Wait until i tell my  ED group about this, The DAWNBREAKERS will be back!!)</p>

<br>
<p>So what actually went wrong with Earthdawn?<p></p>Well, I do have all the 1st ed Products and most of the 2nd ed stuff from LRG as well (I didn&Acirc;&acute;t get around to buy the rest yet), which means I really like the Game.<p></p>The only Problem that Earthdawn has in my opinion is this:<p></p>The Game is hell for Beginners, especially the meaning of steps and the corresponding Dice.<p></p>everyone I have ever played Earthdawn with has complained about only this one thing, The Game has a wonderful Background, some of the Best sourcebooks ever made, and a Game system that really works, provided you know it really well, if you don&Acirc;&acute;t then you spend most of your time wondering what dice to use on the next roll. <p></p>The only thing to get new Earthdawn Players from running after encountering the step system is a group of experienced players who keep them at it up to the point where they have understood the system and get comfortable with it, and that takes anywhere from 3 to 10 sessions in my experience.<p></p>So what does that tell us for the new ED line?<p></p>More or less nothing as the Game system should not and will not be changed.<p></p>Otherwise it tells us that the best RedBrick can do is keep up the Quality of the Game, and we the fans can try to get new players to play the game long enough to realice that the system, as complicated as it seems at first is really good and works just perfectly.<p></p>For me, I just restarted my old ED Campaign (with two new Players), and can&Acirc;&acute;t wait to get my hands on the first new stuff.<p></p>So, Keep on RedBrick and don&Acirc;&acute;t let us wait to long for your first book.</p>

<p>I've got all the 1st ed. products, and a few from LRG, I never really had a hard time getting new players into Earthdawn, no more at least than any other rpg, and alot less then some.  In fact it took off quite well with new players.<p></p>I also enjoyed the sourcebooks and the way they were laid out from character perspectives, the only exception being Throal area book was a hard read.<p></p>The problem I always had was finding people, it's easy to find roleplayers familiar with D&amp;D or the World of Darkness, but even alot of people in game stores were rather unfamiliar with Earthdawn, I agree with the posts saying it needs better word of mouth and demos in stores and at game/geek fests...<p></p>well, there's my spiel,<p></p>Vaughn, SLC,Ut</p>
