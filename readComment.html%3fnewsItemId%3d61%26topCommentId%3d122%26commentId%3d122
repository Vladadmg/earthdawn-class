<b>(Auckland, New Zealand) [October 16, 2003] - RedBrick Limited announced today that they have successfully concluded negotiations for an EARTHDAWN(R) licence with FASA Corporation.</b>
</p>

<p>"To say we're excited about this would be an understatement!" said Richard Vowles, RedBrick Director and Projects Manager. "We have been working with both FASA Corporation and key members of the online EARTHDAWN(R) community for a number of months. Now we are able to publicly move forward with our plans for the EARTHDAWN(R) property."</p>

<p>James Flowers, RedBrick Director and Line Developer said, "We have an ambitious schedule ahead of us. Our licence allows us to take the EARTHDAWN(R) reins and drive forward from the base that FASA Corporation firmly established with the First Edition game line during the 90's. We are looking forward to not only producing a series of high-quality rulebooks and supplements for the EARTHDAWN(R) game line, but also fully supporting the game online via the Internet and, over time, with a range of merchandise and miniatures."</p>

<p>RedBrick's products will be based on the First Edition of FASA Corporation's EARTHDAWN(R) epic fantasy roleplaying game. James Flowers explained, "We didn't want to change the First Edition rules because we felt that nothing was fundamentally broken. It was a conscious decision on our part to ensure that our materials are 100% compatible with the First Edition materials currently in print. While we intend to reprint out-of-print supplements, we will be ensuring that these products are updated to include new content and errata."</p>

<p>When asked about the response from the online fan-base, Richard Vowles replied, "So far it's been extremely enthusiastic. We have had a lot of interest from those who have been working with us to date, providing feedback, criticism and direction. It is an absolute 'must' that we actively engage the EARTHDAWN(R) community in our publishing decisions, and that is one of our earliest goals. We are looking forward to receiving submissions from artists and writers alike in due course."</p>

<p>More information will be made available at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.earthdawnclassic.com">http://www.earthdawn-classic.com</a>

<p>I do wish you every success in this - it doesn't matter which company promotes Earthdawn be it 1st or 2nd edition rules - just so long as Earthdawn is still alive!!

However, it has come to my attention that although new books, new disciplines and new characters are developed there does seem to be a gaping hole where miniatures are concerned. Heartbreaker did a great job with there now OOP selection of Earthdawn stuff and Ral Partha did a few - but that seems to be it!  Is there anybody out there that could produce more miniatures for Earthdawn?  It would seem a shame not to produce new stuff - what about horrors?  Sofar there are only two horrors available in a Heartbreaker blister #311 as well as a despairthought #331 and a couple of wormskulls in the #328 blister.  With all the nasties around in Earthdawn literature it would be nice to have more horrors, monsters, Therans, and even blood elves to paint up and use during gaming sessions.  I realise that many Earthdawn players do not utilise minis in game play but my game group prefer to so that there is some tangible identification.

Come on someone there are many people with money to burn on this - just check out ebay and see the ridiculous amounts of money spent on such OOP miniatures (yeah alright I'm guilty too!)

best of luck with your literary quests, but spare a thought to those that love the representative minis.... (please?)

<p>Hi Woz. We have miniatures on the radar, and are able to produce these under the terms of our license. However, it's still early days for RedBrick and we need to do more work on determining how best to handle this, and who to work with. Heartbreaker are no longer, so the likelihood of bring back their line is slim-to-none. Ral Partha are still a possibility, but yet to be approached. Please be assured that this isn't just a literary exercise, but there are priorities to be determined and a miniatures line will need to be able to be financially sustainable as well. Short answer? Miniatures? Yes, absolutely. When, who and how? Not sure yet...</p>
