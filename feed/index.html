				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn’t like sitting in front of the computer and play different games that are found online. Thanks to the inventor of internet, people can now enjoy online games when they are bored. Online games have benefits that people are yet to know. This is because online games are oftentimes regarded and stereotyped as bad for people who play such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Oftentimes, online games are regarded as a bad influence to many people; this is because these games are addictive. It is true that a person can be addicted to online games and forget what he/she needs to do, or neglects his/her chores because of playing. But did you know that online games can be advantageous to many people when it is played with supervision of parents and/or guardians? That being said, parental guidance is always advised so that the right online games will be played, games that give out more remuneration instead of perils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It is just so amazing how online games became popular in an instant, who would’ve thought that these things, although typecasted as non-healthy activities have a lot of good things to give to a person who enjoys it. Below is a list of benefits that a person may get when he/she plays online games:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Mental Exercise<br />
There are studies that show that people who play online games (educational ones) have better memory than people who do not play. When you play online games, you do not only enjoy the fun that the game give you, you also get to have a brain exercise, and have your mental capabilities work. There are games that will require you to be skillful enough to create a strategy in order to win; this will let your brain create well-thought decisions. Educational games on the other hand will let you think properly so that you can create your own answers to the questions (if there are any). With online games, you will have the chance to show how good you are in thinking, making and deciding which moves you will make while thinking of a way to beat your opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Partaking Values to Others<br />
Online games let people go to the online or the virtual world. Educational games are fun and informative in nature, these games let people of all ages learn and/or improve their creativity as they share values to their co-players. Online games boost cooperation and will let players enjoy and have fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Mended Social Skills<br />
With online games you have a choice to play with the people you know or with total strangers. Playing with people you don’t know will give you a chance to be exposed to people of different countries and different cultures. Some online games have built-in chat rooms that allow players to communicate with each other while playing. Many people found friends because of online games, actually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Body Organization is improved<br />
People who <a title="find league of legends coaching " href="http://gamerunners.gg/" target="_blank">find league of legends coaching </a> or play online games, in particular kids, teenagers, and students have improved eye-to-hand coordination as compared to those who do not play.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people that have experienced bad reception on their cell phones have opted to buy cell phone boosters and are usually happy with the results they provide. Sometimes bad reception on a cell phone can be due to the service provider having no antennae or boosters in your area. This is usually the case in rural areas where they believe that the relatively few users in that area, makes it financially viable to spend money to improve the services reception. This though, can also be a problem in some urban areas but is for a difference reason. In urban areas there certainly are enough people around using cell phone services to warrant placement of antennae but, due to signals weakening on passing through buildings, sometimes areas as big as a few blocks, can experience bad reception. This is more often the case where there are older buildings like churches which, at the time of their building, a lot of metal including lead were used in the building materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore if you live, work or even just visit one of these areas where the reception is bad, you too may want to consider using a cell phone booster. If you do you will have to decide what kind of booster you want as there are some kinds that are ideal for vehicles, particularly handy for motorhomes or campers, some that are specifically designed for desk use but can also be used in small apartments and then there are those kinds which are designed to be used in larger buildings or in the centre of malls which are notorious for having bad reception areas. Although all kinds are available, there are only two major types, the smart signal booster and the analog booster. Although the analog boosters can and often are effective, they do have exterior directional antennae which will probably need professional help to set up. The smart signal boosters are a plug in and go device as they possess internal, multi-directional antennae. Whichever you decide to buy, you can always get <a title="signal booster support" href="http://www.wilsonamplifiers.com" target="_blank">signal booster support</a> but before you buy, you should perhaps look at the laws and regulations that exist in your country, concerning the use of these boosters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the UK it is illegal to use a booster without a license and a license can only be obtained after the service provider has declared that they cannot improve the service in that particular area. Once a license has been obtained, only boosters that meet all EU criteria are allowed to be used.<br />
In Australia, as it is considered that these boosters may interfere with other people’s receptions, they are only allowed to be bought from their service provider and they must keep strict records as to who bought them and where they are being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the United States, as long as the booster complies with FCC regulations, boosters may be used however; those regulations received large updates in 2013 and so ensure your chosen device complies with those updates.</p>
