                                       The birthing was a painful ordeal, and his mother died a year later. His father never forgave him, and constantly bullied
                                       him. As he had fought to even be born, he fought his father&#146;s tyranny. He would endure this trial, and become the greatest
                                       Troll Sky Raider who had ever lived. For his Rite of Passage, he decided to enter the rival Bloodlore clan and steal a Troll
                                       Sword, proving his courage. This event changes his life. During his trial, he seen the way the Bloodlores lived. He saw them
                                       living as true Sky Raiders, and when he returned home, he began to see the difference in his people. They had grown weak by
                                       incorporating Throalic and Lowland troll customs. But he would become a great Sky Raider and change the Stonehearts back to
                                       true Sky Raiders. He took the name Ra&#146;theul Va&#146;arr Stonearm and became a Sky Raider Initiate. He was recognized for his bravery
                                       on several occasions during raids eventually being invited by Ter&#146;a&#146;alla Athelia Rokab into their line marriage. He accepted
                                       and had a son with her called Se&#146;bo Ro&#146;arr Rokab. He even told her his plans for a new Stoneheart trollmoot. His line mate
                                       was alarmed and made sure word got back to Kerthale. Kerthale took it as a huge insult to his katorr and the clan kat&#146;ral.
                                       Kerthale asked him to apologize for what he said, but Ra&#146;theul refused. In the same day, he was divorced from the Rokab family
                                       and underwent the Severance. He had his named changed to Da&#146;ra&#146;nakh Av&#146;uli and was exiled to the Ashen Hills. Living in the
                                       shadow of the Death&#146;s Sea was harsh, and survival was the first priority. He learned of a Discipline called the Outcast Warrior.
                                       The Discipline was made by kava for kava. He asked to be initiated by a Journeyman Outcast Warrior called Ke&#146;stor Nu&#146;gha.
                                       He became a First Circle Outcast Warrior and used his new talents to fight his way out of the Ashen Hills. He came to Bartertown
                                       by way of Kratas. 
                                       
                                       CHARACTER PERSONALITY
                                       	
                                       Surface Traits (Courageous, Intolerant)
                                       	Hidden Traits (Introverted, Vengeful)
                                       
                                       General Appearance: Da&#146;ra&#146;nakh does not pay any attention to personal appearance. Of course, living in ash, and sweating buckets
                                       near the Death Sea have also made him sorely in need of a bath.

                                       which he sees as the Will of Thystonius directly helping him. The true test of a troll is survival of the elements and he
                                       should abandon all civilization. This is why the Stoneheart&#146;s ways never sat with him and this belief got him exiled. He also
                                       believes in revenge, which may lead him from Thystonius to Raggok if he is not careful. 
                                       
                                       Moral Code: &#147;Survival of the Fittest.&#148; As a former Troll Sky Raider, Da&#146;ra&#146;nakh will steal and kill to survive. He never tells
                                       lies in any circumstance, as he believes lies are only necessary in so-called &#147;civilization&#148;.
                                       
                                       Cannot do: Da&#146;ra&#146;nakh refuses to take any quests from dwarves or trolls ever. He cannot return to the Stoneheart moot on punishment
                                       of death.
