                                 <p></p>Somewhere between the Jerris and the Mist Swamps, as vague a geographical location as it may be, is the unexciting village
                                 of Blaan.  Sporting all manner of goods and services and being located right on a major trade route, though a promising start,
                                 did not mean people would stay in Blaan.  Only when forced to stay by heavy rains did trade caravans stay in town, and took
                                 advantage of the local Smithy, the Tavern, and the Brothel.
                                 <p></p>It was on such a night that I was conceived.
                                 <p></p>That's right:  My mother was a prostitute, and my father was a traveller I will never meet.  Perhaps the rains that forced
                                 my conception we're an omen from the Elements, along with my persistent meddling with puddles of mud, the nearby Mists, and
                                 other local natural phenomenon.
                                 <p></p>Regardless, I was discovered by a travelling dwarf who tackled the way of the Elementalist, and took me to the Death's Sea
                                 where my training would commence.  My only loss was Nana, a local widow in Blaan who took the job of raising me while my mother
                                 continued her nocturnal exploits.
                                 <p></p>Her parting gift to me, a yellow, silken scarf, would become my grimoire.<br></td>

                                 <p></p>My training at the Sea took place during an arduous 6 months, where many lessons were quickly learned.  I had mastered a few
                                 spells and was a welcome addition to the several crews that went Fire Elemental mining.
                                 <p></p>Though too inexperienced to actually assist in Fire Gathering, I would help the crew where I could with Air Armour, Resist
                                 Fire, Heal Food, and other spells being cast when required.  It was also interesting to hear the first-hand account of near-death
                                 experiences, wonderous sights, and tales of the province I will evenutally discover for myself.
                                 <p></p>There was one point of tension during all this majesty: my teacher.  The dwarf, who shall remain nameless, is a Specialist

                                 path, and felt leaving the Sea would be the best way for me to know what my path trully is; after all, Fire was the only Element
                                 I knew.
                                 <p></p>Though hesitant, my teacher understood the honesty of my words and sent me to the Twilight Peaks where his friendship with
                                 the Stonetooth Clan would buy me passage with the Trolls.  There I would be exposed to the gracefulness and might of Air and
                                 Earth.
