                                 Ur'ktsk and Verilus offer their services to the town as elemental earth caravan guards.  A somewhat dangerous assignment seeing
                                 as how these shipments have been getting raided on a regular basis for the past five months.  Expecting trouble they are particularly
                                 vigilant, and are fortunate enough to spot an ambush site.  Quietly alerting the rest of the caravan, they drop back in the
                                 caravna and then seek to flank the enemy.  Successfully sneaking up on the ambush site they ambush the ambushers.  At this
                                 point in time the caravan guards, alerted by the sound of battle take this as their cue to charge.  The whole affair is quickly
                                 done with.  A hard one battle in which Verilus did quite well.  This added to his cockiness and would lead to much pain later
                                 on.   The ambushers shared a strange tattoo in common.  Upon returning to Tesrae Meraerthim Verilus and Ur'ktsk were congratulated
                                 and honored with a commission to ferret out any conspirators within the town and end the threat of these raids.

                                 Having returned to town and receiving a commission to uncover traitors, our intrepid heroes decide to start doing some research.
                                 Verilus promptly chooses the duty assignment of interrogating ladies of the night in the hopes that one of their patrons had
                                 mumbled something in their sleep.  Needless to say Verilus spent, much money and enjoyed this end of the research most thoroughly.
                                 Urkutsk desided to do somewhat more scholarly research into the possible origins of the tattoo the raiders had in common.
                                 Speaking to the curator of the library/museum he discovered that it might have something to do with the passions.  Following
                                 a logical progression he proceeded to the Shrine of Mynbruje and spoke to one of the Questors.  The tattoo clearly had something
                                 to do with the mad passion Vestrial.  On his way to find Verilus he ran into Jyn (Verilus Twin Brother), who had just recently
                                 returned from his training abroad.  The two of them found Verilus and formulated a plan.

                                 Having formulated a plan to follow the raiders they shadow a sacrificial caravan, and then track the raiders back to their
                                 home ground.  Intercepting a messenger pigeon they are bestowed with the good fortune of a written message from the conspirator.
                                 Forging a new letter they gove a false time and date for the next caravan.  At this point they decide that three adepts against
                                 a whole camp of zealous fanatics would not be wise.  Returning to town they meet with Barak and the Lord.  Kerym grants them
                                 further powers in order to pursue the investigation.  Jyn and Verilus as usual bicker somewhat in a friendly brother sort
                                 of way.  Contributing to the conversation they and Urkutsk discover that only 20 people have access to caravan information.
                                 Battle is their forte and the convoluted mess of namegivers minds seems to be Urkutsk strength.  Our beastmaster decides that
                                 the bureau of taxation might be the best place to compare handwriting.  They eventually discover that the handwriting matches
                                 that on the tax form of Tyvis Rhee a member of the Council of Elders.  Not jumping the gun they conduct an investigation into
                                 who might fill out his tax forms.

                                 The players escort the 1st and 2nd Infantry Company to the site of the raiders camp.  Along the way they defeat a raging Wyvern
                                 with some assistance from their detail.  Choosing the harder route the places climb through the valleys and mountains  surrounding
                                 their camp.  The 2nd Company launches a frontal assault as the 1st charges down the hills from behind.  The raiders are slaughtered
                                 and much booty is garnished.  Returning to town the players are rewarded with a parade and titles as the Champions of Tesrae
                                 Meraerthim.  They are now a public relations asset for the town, and hold great favor with Lord Kerym.
