                                 As written by Josh Harrison on 19 April 2004 15:23
                                 <p></p>The group returned to Valyan's Legacy, and told Banstar's mentor Cedric that his student had fallen in battle with a Horror.
                                 They also told Erthan and Valin, Kelric's parents, that he had died as well.
                                 <p></p>They were invited to a ceremony where the two fallen comrades had their names inscribed on a memorial to the fallen Defenders
                                 of the Legacy. Kira and Rezak were sworn in as new Defenders, carrying on the work of their late friends.
                                 <p></p>That afternoon, they found a group of green recruits poring excitedly over a map -- which bore a striking resemblance to the
                                 map the group had been carrying for the past few months. The story of how they had obtained this map bore a strong resemblance
                                 to the group's own experience... suspicious, the group joined forces with the other party in hopes of uncovering whatever
                                 plot was in motion.
                                 <p></p>The next few days were uneventful, as they groups followed the map. Then, early on their fifth day of travel, they came upon
                                 a box canyon with the unmistakable large stone doors of a kaer set in the mountainside.
                                 <p></p>Expecting an ambush, the group carefully approached the doors. Despite their caution, the group sprung the ambush. About a
                                 dozen archers rained arrows down on the group, which took shelter in the kaer entrance. Rezak and Gir tried to escape back
                                 up the canyon, only to be captured by more bandits (led by a troll Warrior) who were blocking the exit. In the ensuing struggle,
                                 Rezak was killed in a hail of arrows.
                                 <p></p>Thrak managed to rescue Gir, and took her back into the kaer, where they slammed the doors shut behind them. Now the eight
                                 adepts are locked in a kaer, with an angry bandit gang outside, and who knows what perils inside...<br></td>

                                 <p></p>Soon after Thrak slammed the door to the kaer, Kira heard the distinctive sound of the chain and lock being put back across
                                 the outside.
                                 <p></p>With nothing better to do, the group set out to explore the kaer. All evidence indicated that the kaer was long abandoned
                                 -- aside from some broken rock and bits of trash, there was nothing of real value to be found.
                                 <p></p>One of the rooms in the kaer had a series of murals that depicted the history of the kaer -- from its founding and construction
                                 to its betrayal and destruction by the very person who founded it.
                                 <p></p>Further exploration uncovered the kaer's throne room, and the secret -- and unwarded -- passage to the surface. The passage
                                 was guarded by the cursed, undead spirit of the former lord who built and betrayed the kaer. After a brief but intense fight,
                                 the king was defeated, and his gem-encrusted treasures were recoverered.
                                 <p></p>Rather than rush to the surface, the group spent a couple days holed up in the kaer, healing their wounds from the fight with
                                 the bandits and the undead king.
                                 <p></p>They finally emerged into the sunlight, and tracked the bandits back to their camp. While scouting, Kira had the opportunity
                                 to steal the bandit leader's bow. She took to opportunity, and flew off with it. The rest of the group attacked, and defeated
                                 the bandit leader, his troll lieutenant, and the bandits present in the camp.
                                 <p></p>The group made plans to return to Valyan's Legacy to see if they could sell the loot taken from the undead king and the bandit
