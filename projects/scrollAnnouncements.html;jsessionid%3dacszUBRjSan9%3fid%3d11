                        Before science, before history, an era of magic existed in our world's dim past. Magic flowed freely, touching every aspect
                        of the lives of men and women of the Name-giver races. It was an age of heroes, an age of fantastical deeds and mythical stories.
                        It was the Age of Legend.<p/>In August 2005, <b>Earthdawn</b> was back with a new edition. Roll forward to December 2005.
                        For the first time since its initial release in 1993, this highly acclaimed fantasy roleplaying game is now available in an
                        all-encompassing format -- two comprehensive books containing everything required for years of play. The second of these two
                        books is the <b>Earthdawn Gamemaster's Compendium</b>, featuring:<p/>* Revised and streamlined game mechanics<br/>* Campaign
                        information on the province of Barsaive<br/>* Over a hundred creatures, dragons, spirits and Horrors, including a system for
                        creating and customizing your own creatures!<br/>* Guidelines on gamemastering and creating campaigns<br/>* Combines updated
                        content from over six previously-published supplements into one volume, along with new and optional rules.<p/><b>Earthdawn</b>
                        is set in a world of high adventure, high magic, and terrible danger. Trolls, dwarfs, elves, orks, and humans live side by
                        side with exotic races: the lizard-like t'skrang, the small, winged windlings, and the earthen obsidimen. In the Age of Legend,
                        bold heroes from all across Barsaive band together -- ready to fight for life and freedom against the remaining Horrors and
                        the oppressive Theran Empire, which seeks to bend the rebellious province again to their yoke. Through noble deeds and sacrifice,
                        the heroes of the world forge Barsaive's future, arming themselves for their daunting task with powerful magical spells and
                        treasures.<p/>This rulebook contains all the information gamemasters need to create and run ongoing adventures and campaigns

                        Hi everyone,<br/><br/>Well, it has been a while, but here is an update on where things lie. Firstly, the status of the Player's
                        Compendium hardcover. After some fun wrestling with InDesign CS2, Acrobat and Digital RIP compatabilities, we received the
                        galley proofs for the hardcover a couple of days ago. And they look great! However... Some other errors have crept into the
                        printing process and we're going to have to get these straightened out. So I'm afraid we're into another bout of to-ing and
                        fro-ing with the printer. Hopefully this is something minor which can be resolved quickly. You can have a look at some photos
                        at the Lore Merchant web site (http://lore-merchant.org). Josh has posted some pictures up, along with a couple of shots of
                        the problem. Realistically, with the time needed to do another galley run, I don't think we're going to be ready for orders
                        before Xmas. Hopefully I'm wrong.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we're just finishing up the Gamemaster's Compendium. Index is
                        underway, which, once complete, means we should have this up in PDF on DriveThruRPG in the next week or so. Coincidentally,
                        this means that the print version will probably be available at the same time as the Player's Compendium. It wasn't planned
                        this way, but looks like it's just how things have worked out. The Gamemaster's Compendium is 524 pages.<br/><br/>Richard
                        has already posted that Miniatures are available from the RedBrick web site. Thanks to those who have ordered early. If the
                        current lines go well, we will be looking at expanding it with new miniatures. Early days. Personally, I'm looking forward
                        to getting some time to do some painting. It's been too long... Please note the Merchandise Competition is on. Do leap in
                        and come up with suggestions. You've got nothing to lose! Also, the EDPT (http://www.edpt.org) is running a Writing Competition.
                        Details are on that site. We'll post a separate entry reminder here. Prizes are some Earthdawn books, so sharpen your pencils
                        and get writing!<br/><br/>Other news? Following on from the Gamemaster's Compendium is the adventure supplement Ardanyan's
                        Revenge, then the Name-giver's Compendium (with completely revised Disciplines, including the Shaman and Horror Stalker).
                        We've also got the other releases well under way for next year, including the Adventure Compendium and a brand new sourcebook
                        for Cathay. No firm release dates on these yet. Just letting you know that we're not sitting around here!<br/><br/>Lastly,
                        we are looking at softcover versions of the books as well (with a lower price point for those who might want a second book
                        or can't afford the hardcover). Plus there's a bunch of freebies sitting in the wings. And some other stuff which I'll tell
                        you about later.<br/><br/>OK, back to work! Be well,<br/><br/>JAMES FLOWERS<br/>Product Director, RedBrick Limited<br/>http://www.earthdawn.com
