                        This miniature is from line of pewter Chainmail miniatures - WotC's predecessor to D&amp;amp;D Miniatures.  The line as a
                        whole contained mostly two-dimensional sculpts with no depth, but the Stonechild makes an excellent obsidiman.  It's even
                        scaled a bit taller than most 25mm figures.  It is, however, extremely hard to find at this point.<p/>This miniature's "flesh"
                        was painted using the granite technique from the Hot-Lead.org web site.  Everything else is rather unremarkable.  I wish I
                        would have highlighted the stone undercoat before I did the speckling - I think it could be more defined.  This miniature
                        sees use representing most obsidiman fighter-types the party meets.<p/>Metallics are Games Workshop.  Everything else is painted
                        with Applebarrel and Delta Ceramcoat paints.

                        This mini's NMM (my second attempt, actually) photographs much better than it looks in person.  The Dark Elf Corsair miniatures
                        all have great Sea Dragon Cloaks, which make good Espagra-Scale in a pinch.  Another early miniature done before I started
                        using Vallejo's, this miniature was also one of my first attempts at weapon-swapping. <p/>Originally this figure had the axe
                        in his right hand which I removed and replaced with a sword.  The sword itself was built using the hand and hilt of a plastic
                        Dark Elf Warrior sprue combined with a spear tip from the same sprue.  His right hand and the decapitated head it held was
                        removed and a closed fist was put in its place.  The arm looked 'empty' so I chopped the blade off the axe I tool from his
                        right hand and glued it to his bracer to look like a punch dagger/wrist carver.  I'd like to go back and repaint this miniature
                        now that my skills ahve improved, but haven't had the time.<p/>Since this miniature has no metallic paint on it, everything
                        is painted with Applebarrel and Delta Ceramcoat paints.

                        This miniature was assembled from various pieces of the Games Workshop Mordheim Mercenary plastic sprue to represent our group's
                        archer.  The face seems to have turned our well, but the miniature is not perfect.  It's difficult to see the black picking
                        on the fletching from this angle, but it's there.  <p/>Flesh done in Vallejo Model Color.  Metallics in Games Workshop paints.

                        Constructed from a Games Workshop Mordheim Zombie Sprue, this miniature tends to be a favorite around the gaming table.  Not
                        due to the paint job (which was done during a speed-painting session to get a number of minor miniatures done), but because
                        of the fear the first Cadaverman it represented put in the party.  Anyone willing to rip off their own leg and beat an adept
                        senseless with it deserves some respect.  :)<p/>Painted in Applebarrel and Delta Ceramcoat paints.

                        A miniature from the old Heartbreaker Earthdawn line.  I was rather happy with how this miniature turned out.  The living

                        I was temped to go with Ago-Frod at first, but liked the warm feeling the Ago-Chad crystals gave.  Plus next to the contrasting

                        Some Earthdawn characters are relatively hard to represent with miniatures.  Tridae, our group's Ork Beastmaster, was one
                        of them.  Claws just aren't common weapons on miniatures, but luckily Reaper put out Lurg here.  It's not perfect, but at
                        the claw weapon and dreadlocks make this the closest we could find.  The ribbed underclothing was originally green, but the
                        finished product reminded me of Peppermint Patty so that had to change.  The player's second choice was red, so I went with
                        that.  The camera washed out some of the red's shading, but you can still see some of it.  <p/>Flesh done in Vallejo Model

                        This miniature was inspired by a version painted by Jen Haley located at http://www.wegotgame.net/jen/rictur.html.  Her paint
                        job was the only reason I picked this mini up - I just thought it looked great.  This was probably the first mini I thought
                        I did a decent job of, though hers is far better.  This miniatures flesh was done in craft paints way back before I started
                        using Vallejos.  The cloak shading is a little deeper in person, but for one of my earlier minis, I was very happy with the
                        smoothness of it.  I think I might go back and paint the metal on the two-handed sword to look like a sheath - I don't think
                        the NMM turned out too well.  The punch dagger and metal studs on the armor were small enough that they turned out much better.
                        This miniature has seen use as both a thief, as well as a warrior/swordmaster type.<p/>Metallics are Games Workshop. Everything
                        else is painted with Applebarrel and Delta Ceramcoat paints.

                        My fiancee picked this one out as her character in Earthdawn - a Dinganni Warrior. She's mostly metallics so wasn't too hard.
                        The sword was painted to look like cracked ice on the gaming table.  It's a little abrupt this close up, but does look better
                        in person.  The armor is Boltgun Metal + Black to darken with Tin Bitz + Shining Gold trim.  The hilt of the sword is Shining
                        Gold.  <p/>I'm planning on changing the back part of her cloth skirt, but haven't decided on what to do with it yet.  Maybe
                        a stormy pattern since she's wearing the Storm Armor in-game.<p/>Flesh done in Vallejo Model Color. Metallics in Games Workshop

                        Another mini painted up as an obsidiman.  This golem is larger than standard 25mm figures - it's a little taller then the
                        Heartbreaker Sky Raider.  I did a better job highlighting the stone before I speckled it than with the Chainmail Stonechild,
                        so the cracks and crags stand out much better on this one.  You can see a lot of imperfections sculpted on the leather skirt.
                        This figure's supposed to be completely stone, but I wanted an obdidiman instead of a golem so I painted it as leather.  This
                        miniature served as the Obisidiman Wizard in our party before the player decided he wanted to play something else.<p/>Painted
                        with Applebarrel and Delta Ceramcoat paints.
