We're moving along with a number of products. In particular, the Compendiums are getting a thorough workover at present, on their way to getting them to Playtest status. Thanks for your all your patience to date. Hard to believe that 4 months has gone by, but it has! To answer the obvious question? No firm ETA for books at this stage, but we're making good progress, and our original plan is still running on schedule. Be assured that once we get firm release dates, you'll read it here first. Take kaer, JAMES FLOWERS (Line Developer, RedBrick Limited)</description><dc:subject>Announcement</dc:subject><dc:creator>James Flowers</dc:creator><dc:date>2004-04-03T05:13:43+12:00</dc:date></item><item xmlns="" rdf:about="http://www.earthdawn-classic.com:80/readMore.html?id=1438"><title>Book Of Tomorrow Now Taking Articles For Issue 5 (Richard Vowles)</title><link>http://www.earthdawn-classic.com:80/readMore.html?id=1438</link><description>The EDPT would like to officially announce that they
are taking article submissions for Book of Tomorrow
issue 5. The deadline for first drafts is May 31,
2004. As usual, the EDPT is having a contest for the
best article, but for BoT5, the prize is a little
different -- instead of a copy of an in-print
Earthdawn book, they are offering a limited edition
hardcover Earthdawn rulebook (the 'red book'),
numbered 234 out of 1000. More information can be
found in BoT4, and they'll be putting together a more
comprehensive announcement soon, to be posted on the
edpt-l, earthdawn and earthdawn-gm mailing lists, as
well as several forums, including EDPT's own forum, and WERG.</description><dc:subject>Announcement</dc:subject><dc:creator>Richard Vowles</dc:creator><dc:date>2004-04-03T05:12:54+12:00</dc:date></item><item xmlns="" rdf:about="http://www.earthdawn-classic.com:80/readMore.html?id=1347"><title>Nightmares of mine... (Richard Vowles)</title><link>http://www.earthdawn-classic.com:80/readMore.html?id=1347</link><description>I came across this book as a recommendation from those who run Horror oriented games and purchased it on eBay - it is out of print by I.C.E still sell it. It is really the very best "how to" roleplaying book that I have read - it covers all of the details you would need to know about how to write and run an excellent horror based scenario. It has no game specifics in it, and mentions are a wide range of different roleplaying games. If you are interested in it, it can be picked up from I.C.E's store at this location.</description><dc:subject>General</dc:subject><dc:creator>Richard Vowles</dc:creator><dc:date>2004-02-09T00:42:50+13:00</dc:date></item><item xmlns="" rdf:about="http://www.earthdawn-classic.com:80/readMore.html?id=1146"><title>Updated Publications Roster Posted (James Flowers)</title><link>http://www.earthdawn-classic.com:80/readMore.html?id=1146</link><description>RedBrick's Earthdawn Publications Roster has been updated.
