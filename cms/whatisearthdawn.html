               <div style="text-align: center;"><font size="5" style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT IS EARTHDAWN?</font><br /></div>
               <br />Earthdawn is a pen-and-paper roleplaying game designed for two to six players. Like many other roleplaying games,  
               Earthdawn                            has an open-ended style of play. That is, the game has no definitive ending, no preset
               time limit or number of turns of play,                            and no single goal that, when achieved, marks the end of
               the game. Unlike other types of games, however, there is no winner                            or loser. The object of the
               game is to have fun while exercising your imagination. When this happens, everybody wins.<br />The world of Earthdawn    
               is one of legend. Its people and places are larger than life, the stuff of song and saga. Heroes                         
               fight the monsters of this and other worlds; their bold exploits light a beacon of hope for the future, as word of their deeds
               spreads across the troubled, fearful land. Earthdawn is a world of high adventure, high magic, and terrible danger. Those
               dangers lurk not only within long-forgotten kaers, but also within the minds of people forever corrupted by the Horrors. To
               rebuild its heart and soul as well as its outward aspect after the devastation of the Scourge, the world needs heroes. The
               players of Earthdawn, by creating their characters and playing the game, provide these heroes.<br />In contrast to many  
               other roleplaying games, characters in Earthdawn do not simply survive each adventure and become a little smarter or a little
               richer. Earthdawn adds another dimension to roleplaying; its characters become heroic figures, accomplishing deeds so impressive
               that generation after generation will honor their memory in song and story. The world of Earthdawn brims over with legends,
               heart-stirring tales of famous adventurers told by the fireside to while away the night. Earthdawn player characters can become
               the figures in those legends. As they build their characters&rsquo; legends through play, they create the fireside tales 
               that their descendants will tell about them. Gaining this heroic stature through daring deeds is as important a part of playing
               Earthdawn <br /><font size="4"><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is a Roleplaying Game?</span></font><br
               />Everyone has read a book or seen a movie where                            the protagonist does something so utterly wrong
               that the reader or viewer wants to shout a warning to the character. But no                            warning from the audience
               can keep that character from doing what the plot demands, no matter how much trouble it lands him                        
               in. The readers and viewers can&rsquo;t change the character&rsquo;s behavior; we&rsquo;re just along for the            
               ride. A roleplaying game turns this situation on its ear. In a roleplaying game the players control the actions, or play the
               roles, of their characters and respond as they wish to the events of the plot. If the player doesn&rsquo;t want his character
               to go through a door, the character won&rsquo;t. If the player thinks his character can talk himself out of a tight situation
               rather than resorting to that trusty sword, he can talk away. The plot of a roleplaying game is flexible, ultimately based
               on the decisions the players make for their characters.<br />In roleplaying, stories (the adventures) evolve much as     
               they do in a movie or book, but within the flexible story line created by the gamemaster. The story outlines what might happen
               at certain times or in reaction to other events. The story remains an outline, with few concrete events, until the players
               become involved. When that happens, the adventure can become a drama as riveting as that great movie you saw last week or
               the book you stayed up all night to finish.<br />Though the players all contribute to the story, creating it as they     
               play, the gamemaster creates the overall outline and controls events. The gamemaster keeps track of what happens and when,
               describes events as they occur so that the players (as characters) can react to them, keeps track of other characters in the
               game (referred to as gamemaster characters), and uses the game system to resolve the players&rsquo; attempts to take action.
               The gamemaster describes the world as the characters see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and other senses. Gamemastering
               takes both skill and practice to master, but the thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other players, tests both
               their gaming skills and the characters&rsquo; skills in the game world, and captures the players&rsquo; imaginations     
               makes the gamemaster&rsquo;s job worthwhile. While there are many published game supplements and adventures to aid the   
               gamemaster, talented gamemasters always adapt the game world to suit their own and their players&rsquo; style.<br />A    
               roleplaying game offers its players a level of challenge and personal involvement unmatched by any other type of game. Because
               the players and gamemaster create the adventures they play, what happens in the course of a roleplaying game is limited only
               by your imagination.<br />The game is not a contest between the players and the gamemaster, however. The gamemaster      
               may control all the bad guys, but he should work with the players to build and experience a tense, exciting adventure.<br
               /><br /><font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">The World of Earthdawn</font><br />After centuries of hiding beneath the
               earth, humanity has ventured out into the sunlight to reclaim the world. Trolls,                            dwarfs, elves,
               orks, and humans live side by side with other, more exotic, races: the lizard-like t&rsquo;skrang, the                   
               small, winged windlings, and the earthen obsidimen. Creatures both magical and mundane dwell once more in the forests and
               jungles. Arcane energies offer power to those willing to learn the ways of magic.<br />Once, long ago, the land grew     
               lush and green. Thriving forests sheltered plants and animals, and people grew and prospered off the land&rsquo;s bounty.
               Then the Horrors came, and drowned the world in darkness.<br />The world&rsquo;s flow of magic rose and at its height    
               dread creatures from the darkest depths of astral space crossed into our world, leaving suffering and destruction in their
               wake. The world&rsquo;s inhabitants named these fell creatures the Horrors. They laid our world waste in a terrible time 
               now known as the Scourge. The lush forests died. Bustling towns vanished. Beautiful grasslands and majestic mountains became
               blasted, barren terrain, home to the Horrors&rsquo; twisted mockery of life.<br />The Horrors lusted to destroy          
               all life, but they did not succeed. Before their coming, the magicians of the Theran Empire warned the world, and the people
               of the Earth took shelter under it. They built fantastic underground cities called kaers and citadels; their children and
               their children&rsquo;s children grew up within these earthen enclaves, never seeing the light of the sun. For four hundred
               years the Horrors roamed the land, devouring all they touched while the people hid in terror, until the slow ebb of the world&rsquo;s
               magic forced these loathsome creatures to retreat to the astral pit that spawned them. The Horrors departed before the magicians
               and wise men had believed they would; the wary people emerged slowly from their kaers, facing the world half in hope that
               the Scourge had truly ended and half in fear that the Horrors lingered. Though most of the Horrors left this world, many of
               them remain, inflicting cruel anguish and suffering on other living creatures. As humanity struggles to remake the shattered
               world, they must combat the remaining Horrors who seek to prolong the destruction and despair of the Scourge.<br />Now   
               heroes travel the land, rediscovering its lost legends and exploring its changed face. For the world has changed, almost beyond
               recognition. Many people died during the Scourge; the Horrors breached some kaers and citadels and destroyed their inhabitants.
               Other kaers remain sealed, from unknowable disaster or simple fear; their contents await discovery by bold explorers. Should
               they find any folk still living within, these brave adventurers may lead such fear-darkened souls out to live again in the
               light.<br />The dwarven kingdom of Throal lies at the center of the province of Barsaive, the largest inhabited province 
               in the known world. The dwarfs seek to unite Barsaive&rsquo;s far-flung cities and people under one crown and banner,    
               the better to repel the advances of the Theran Empire that ruled Barsaive before the Scourge. The Therans returned to the
               province shortly after the Scourge ended, seeking to bend it again to their yoke, but the people of Barsaive rejected the
               Therans&rsquo; iron rule and rallied behind the dwarfs of Throal. Beaten for the moment, the Therans gather strength and 
               wait to strike again. As Barsaive&rsquo;s heroes search for lost treasures and battle fantastic creatures, they must also
               fight the Therans, who plot to rob Barsaive of its new-found freedom and make its people pawns of their vast Empire.<br />In
               the Age of Legend, heroes band together fighting the Horrors and reclaiming the wounded world for those born in it.      
               As they explore the altered land, searching for legendary cities and treasures, they become the legends that will light the
               coming days. Like those who went before them, tales of their deeds will live forever in men&rsquo;s hearts. From many    
               paths, the heroes come to join in common cause. Those who seek honor and glory come from many Disciplines, and battle evil
               to redeem the world with a multitude of gifts. A band of heroes may include an Illusionist, a magician who combines deception
               and reality to confuse those around him; a Swordmaster, one trained in the art of fighting with bladed weapons; or a Beastmaster,
               able to train and command the beasts of the earth and sky. The world holds countless heroes, but all share one trait: a willingness
               to fight to reclaim the world from that which threatens it. Through noble deeds and sacrifice, the heroes of the world will
               forge its future.<br /><br /><font size="1">Copyright (c) 2005 FASA Corporation, RedBrick Limited.
