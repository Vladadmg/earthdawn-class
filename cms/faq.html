               <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
               <p/>
               <p>Welcome to the RedBrick Earthdawn Classic FAQ. Here we hope you will find answers to your questions. If you don't please
               feel free to <link url="/cms/contactus.html">Contact Us</link>
               and we will attempt to answer your question (and probably add it to the FAQ!).  </p>
               
               <b>1. So who are you?</b><br/>
               <p>RedBrick Limited is based in Auckland, New Zealand, and currently consists of four main staff - James Flowers, Richard
               Vowles, Josh Harrison, and Carsten Damm. Additional to these people are several co-developers -- Carlton Anderson and Steven
               Black, among others -- who are proving invaluable in their ability to work through the mountain of material we have and wrestle
               into a consistent well-ordered state.</p>
               
               <b>2. What does EDC mean?</b><br/>
               <p>EDC is the abbreviation we are using to denote Earthdawn Classic material. The Earthdawn Classic products are based on
               the FASA-published Earthdawn supplements. This has evolved over the last year. The Earthdawn Classic materials are primarily
               going to be in the form of reprints and PDFs of FASA supplements (starting with out-of-print books). The changes in the new
               books have meant we have had to look at how we are presenting new materials.</p>
               
               <b>3. What are you planning on doing?</b><br/>
               <p>Our goal is to breathe new life into Earthdawn and firmly establish the line again by creating high-quality roleplaying
               products. Check our News page for updates and upcoming products!</p>
               
               <b>4. Does this mean a different metaplot?</b><br/>
               <p>It "could" mean a different metaplot. At the moment, RedBrick does not intend following the metaplot beyond products like
               Prelude to War, Orks of Cara Fahd, Crystal Raiders of Barsaive, Secret Societies of Barsaive, and the unpublished Dragons
               book.</p>
               
               <b>5. So what are you going to publish?</b><br/>
               <p>We have a whole heap of ideas of what we want to publish. Some will be in online format, some will be in printed format,
               and there are other things in the works as well. The initial releases will be the Player's and Gamemaster's Compendiums. Like
               the bricks that form the foundations of a building, these are the two "core" books on which the next releases will be based.</p>
               
               <b>6. Won't this fragment a small ED community even more?</b><br/>
               <p>We don't think so. Not any more that it already is. Time will tell.</p>
               
               <b>7. Do you have a mascot?</b><br/>
               <p>A bog gob was mooted by James, but he is also keen on plush t'skrang (from an ED Mailing List suggestion...). We're not
               sure what he would do with one, but he talks about it quite often! Mind you, James also talks about bog gobs a lot as well...
               We have license rights to produce merchandise (some already out and more on the way) and make miniatures (See further down),
               so there may become a favorite from there.</p>
               
               <b>8. You have a spelling mistake on your web site.</b><br/>
               <p>Oh? Sorry. Please let us know where it is (except for other people's postings, of course).</p>
               
               <b>9. So do you own Earthdawn now?</b><br/>
               <p>Nope. We just license it from FASA Corporation.</p>
               
               <b>10. Your web site is pretty boring!</b><br/>
               <p>Yeah, sorry about that. Getting the basic site functionality working was considered the most important priority. Once we
               have some books ready for print, things will change. We have Sade colouring some existing Earthdawn art for us at the moment,
               so expect to see more of her work gracing our pages.</p>
               
               <b>11. Sometimes I can't get to your web site?</b><br/>
               <p>Given that updates are made on a regular basis, the server will be down for short periods of time. By short, we usually
               mean 1-2 minutes - anything longer than this is probably a bigger problem! Please do try again. It's the price to pay for
               a dynamic, fan involved web site! Note that, due to time zones differences (New Zealand is GMT+12) we are sometimes asleep
               if the site goes down. Just means it might be a bit longer before we bring it back up. Richard is contantly updating and refining
               the code to finetune the site stability.</p>
               
               <b>12. So do you want fan involvement?</b><br/>
               <p>Yes, absolutely. Although we will tend to primarily rely on "professional" writers for some material (the stuff that you
               really want as core books) that doesn't mean you can't be involved from an ideas, proofing, supplementary material, art, whatever,
               perspective. If you want to contribute to EDC, we welcome you with open arms. If you consider yourself up to "professional"
               writing, you'll want our Submission guidelines (available from the Downloads menu). We're not precious about this, however.
               There's a lot of Earthdawn fans out there, and we're keen to engender support for the game now and going forward. Please be
               conscious that sometimes we have to make "hard" decisions that won't appeal to everyone. That, my friends, is the price of
               business (and part of the nature of our hobby).</p>
               
               <b>13. Why don't you publish for Second Edition?</b><br/>
               <p>We want to keep our materials more in line with FASA's supplements, taking existing material and adding extra content to
               it in a similar manner. We feel that the direction that LRG have taken is not where we want to go with the product. That doesn't
               mean the two lines will be incompatible!</p>
               
               <b>14. But you can't buy First Edition anymore!</b><br/>
               <p>Yes you can, from <a href="http://www.stiggybaby.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=FASED">StiggyBaby</a>.
               StiggyBaby has some stock of First Edition books left. We encourage people who purchase from them as they are an excellent
               vendor. They will also supply your local gaming store if you ask them. As noted earlier, we are also looking at re-releasing
               those books that are out of print and that will take some time to go through the review process. Some of these can be found
               at <a href="http://www.dtrpg.com">Drivethrough RPG</a>. We figure most people really want new material rather than existing
               stuff, but following the release of the Player's and Gamemaster's Compendiums, there will be new players who won't be able
               to get access to things like Vivane and Parlainth, so we intend to make those available again.</p>
               
               <b>15. Are you going to use Anime art?</b><br/>
               <p>No, not unless we do Earthdawn Anime, which we have nowhere in our plans (I can safely say). No one here at RedBrick really
               likes that art style. If you do, sorry. We like the FASA style - Laubenstein, MacDougall, Nelson, and others.</p>
               
               <b>16. Will you be distributing in the US? Elsewhere?</b><br/>
               <p>At the moment, we can confirm distribution from the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australasia. We're also
               looking at online options for eBook formats as well - <a href="http://www.dtrpg.com">DriveThuRPG</a>, for example.</p>
               
               <b>17. So how are you going to expand Earthdawn?</b><br/>
               <p>Word of mouth is a strong medium. We will be relying on fan support for the game line. On top of that, RedBrick will be
               attending major conventions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. While we don't have bottomless travel and marketing
               budgets, we hope to use more conventional advertising (magazines, and so on) as well. More to share in this area as we move
               forward.</p>
               
               <b>18. Who are your Questors anyway?</b><br/>
               <p>So far those who have agreed to be Named are: Bradley Robins, Kathy Czechowski, J. Anne Mauck, Lou Prosperi, Jacob Jorvang,
               Lars Gottlieb, Andrew and Tiffany Ragland, and Christopher Mahoney.</p>
               
               <b>19. Is your schedule going to conflict with LRG?</b><br/>
               <p>Possibly. But hopefully not in the short-term. We may be approaching some similar material differently from Living Room
               Games. We have initiated some dialog with the LRG team and look forward to working with them on any areas where there are
               obvious synergies for us both.</p>
               
               <b>20. What is RSS?</b><br/>
               <p>It's an online syndication method that allows the news information from web sites to come to you. There are a number of
               software applications out there that support this format - one that is recommended is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/feedreader/">FeedReader</a>.</p>
               
               <b>21. So are you going to do miniatures?</b><br/>
               <p>Yes, we sure are. We are in the process of getting the existing Heartbreaker miniatures and then we will be casting and
               re-selling these. If you have a FLGS that wants to stock them, please let us know. There are about 50 or so packages that
               Heartbreaker put out, but we may not be following the same packaging structure - it depends on their popularity.</p>
               
               <b>22. So what has changed in Earthdawn Classic?</b><br/>
               <p>A lot. And at the same time, not a lot. A vague answer to be sure. More than can be explained in a FAQ, anyway. While we
               are keen to ensure as much compatibility with earlier/other editions as possible, it quickly became evident as we were combining
               the material from multiple sources together that we had a bigger job on our hands that we anticipated. To that end, and the
               reality that the game hasn't seen a major overhaul since its release in 1993 (over a decade ago), it was became more appropriate
               to approach the game "refresh" differently. Check the blogs out for design notes from the line and co-developers. With well

               <b>23. What's all the talk about a Third Edition?</b><br/>
               <p>Earthdawn Classic has been designed to remain as close to the original FASA material as possible. While the Classic line
               is due to release very soon, we have decided to spend more time with the rules and go back to the basics with Earthdawn: Age
               of Legend (or ED3). Roleplaying game mechanics have evolved in the past decade, and we will try to bring the Earthdawn rules
               into the 21st century. Don't expect these anytime soon, however: lifting the Earthdawn game to a whole new level may take
               years.</p>
               
               <b>24. Can I become a playtester/developer for RedBrick?</b><br/>
               <p>Yes, you probably can. We will call for playtesters and developers when the time is due, so check back to our site frequently!</p>
               
               <b>25. Who is the Earthdawn Line Developer?</b><br/>
               <p>James Flowers is our overall Product Director and Line Developer for Earthdawn. While Carsten Damm, Josh Harrison, and
               Richard Vowles serve as advisors, James is the one making the final decisions. We also have Lead Developers, who manage the
               details on one or more of our projects (for example, Carsten Damm is the Lead Developer for ED3).</p>

               <p>Not often enough judging by the amount of changes we needed to make to add item 26 to the list! Last updated: 3rd June
