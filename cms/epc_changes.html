               <div style="text-align: center;"><font size="5" style="font-weight: bold;">Player&rsquo;s Compendium: What&rsquo;s changed?
               A summary.</font><br /></div>
               <br />The Player&rsquo;s Compendium intends to be the definitive book for Earthdawn gamers, taking characters from       
               the                            First to Fifteenth Circle in their Disciplines. We have worked for about 18 months to include
               everything needed in an extended                            campaign lasting for years. The following should give you an overview
               of what has changed from First Edition - bear in mind                            that this is only a loose summary, for most
               of the details you&rsquo;ll need to read the book.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span><br />After collecting
               all the material we found in the                            books, we needed to bring the content into                   
               a coherent state. The information we were dealing with for this book was written                            by a number of
               authors over span of several years. The Earthdawn Player&rsquo;s Compendium contains virtually all material              
               from: Earthdawn First Edition, Earthdawn Companion, Magic: A Manual of Mystic Secrets, Arcane Mysteries of Barsaive, The Adept&rsquo;s
               Way, all of the Game Information chapters found in the original sourcebooks, and some new material that was needed to &rsquo;fill
               the holes&rsquo;. Every chapter listed below was reworded, expanded, reorganized and updated to include more detail, better
               explanations and more examples. It&rsquo;s safe to say that we edited every single sentence in order to bring the rules  
               to                            the state they are in now.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How                 
               It Came To Pass</span><br />We updated the history of Barsaive and Thera to include the events of Prelude to War,        
               which is the time Earthdawn Classic                            picks up. The official year of the setting is 1510TH. We also
               included a timeline for easy reference.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game Concepts</span><br />The most significant
               change in this chapter                            affects the whole game and makes the system faster                     
               to play: Bonuses and Penalties. In previous editions, bonuses and penalties                            directly affected the
               Step Number of the Action Test, which not only resulted in the need to apply the modifiers before the                    
               dice were rolled, but also in looking up and gather the dice required for the new step. This generally brings the game to
               a grinding halt whenever a test is made. We changed bonuses and penalties in a way that they affect the test result - which
               means that players can roll the dice noted on their Character Record Sheets and worry about the modifiers later (thus minimizing
               the number of on-the-fly Step/Action Dice recalculations players and gamemasters need to make). Of course, the option of interpreting
               bonuses and penalties as step modifiers still exists for people who want to play it the old-fashioned way.<br />Another  
               change affects the Success Levels - which are now called Result Levels. This has been subject to much debate and confusion.
               How can a test be called a Success if it failed (which would be the case when a Good Success is required, but the player only
               scores an Average Success)? By using Result Levels, this doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore. A simple change for sure, but it  
               makes                            the concept easier to grasp. In addition, we have introduced a new name for the result level
               below Poor - which is now called                            a Pathetic result (adding insult to injury :).<br /><br style="font-weight:
               bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating Characters</span><br />The most notable changes in this chapter are that
               starting characters                            now have 8 skill points                            to spend in total, and the
               inclusion of guidelines for creating experienced characters. We have also                                                
               dropped the concept of Legend Point costs for Karma based on a character&rsquo;s race - every Karma Point now costs the  
               same:                            10 Legend Points.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disciplines</span><br />Each
               of the 15 core Disciplines comes in its own chapter, with a leading chapter describing                            how Disciplines
               work in general and                            what Talent Crises are all about. The individual chapters come            
               in two sections - fictional essays and Game Information. Needless                            to say, this section covers a
               large part of the book. The game mechanics of the Disciplines have seen a good amount of work,                           
               but we tried to keep as close to the First Edition as possible. Oddities in the talent progressions were replaced with better
               alternatives; and we balanced the Discipline Bonuses, number of Discipline Talents, and Discipline Abilities with a new Discipline
               Design system (which will be available as a free download later this year). The Discipline Abilities have been reworked entirely,
               and some had to be replaced by new ones.<br />It is worth noting that Summoning now works completely talent-based, with  
               a revised version of the Summon talent available at Fifth Circle for the Elementalist and Nethermancer Disciplines.<br /><br
               /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Talents</span><br />Almost all talent effects                            were revised and
               brought into a coherent state. Some talents were changed entirely, others were renamed. We also removed the              
               need for Talent Bonuses. Lots of details in this chapter, so it&rsquo;s probably best to move on.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Talent Knacks</span><br />We added a couple of Talent Knacks to balance                            the number of knacks
               available to each Discipline. The effects of exiting knacks were revised and we have dropped a number                    
               of knacks which seemed redundant or game-breaking. Enchanting now uses an approach based on Talent Knacks - the precedent
               was given by the Name Spell knack, and we expanded this to give the gamemaster more control on who can enchant what kind of
               item. The talent knack learning cost was increased as part of the revision.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills</span><br
               />We altered the learning times for skills to make them a little more attractive                            to players, and
               we opened up the possibility to use more of them with the default Attribute. It is now possible to get a decent          
               skill rank in a short time, but it still takes years before a character can achieve mastery in a given skill. Talents as Skills
               were included as general skills, giving a better overview of what choices are available.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Magic</span><br />The magic chapters have seen lots of rewordings and were generally edited for                   
               clarity, covering how magic works in general, how to use threads, spells, familiars and astral space. Notable rules changes
               include Casting from a Grimoire, which now allow for casting spells from one&rsquo;s own grimoire and introduce cursed   
               and                            tainted grimoires. All of the spells (over 450 in total) were revised.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Combat</span><br />The combat system has been expanded by a number of                            new optional rules
               and Situation                            Modifiers have been expanded to cover a greater number of possibilities         
               - the modifiers given here are referenced throughout                            the rules. Apart from a general revision,
               the chapter has been reorganized and we have clarified and defined the different                            attack types and
               techniques available.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Building Your Legend</span><br />While Earthdawn offers
               a lot                                            of options to customize a character already,                            we
               have included additional guidelines and clarifications which allow gamemasters                            to tailor the  
               system even closer to the needs of their group. This mostly affects the Multi-Discipline rules, which often              
               lead to all kinds of redundant abilities.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Goods and                          
               Services</span><br />A good number of new items                            have found their way into this chapter,       
               along with revised rules for Trading and items of better quality. It&rsquo;s a                            large          
               collection of stuff, so there isn&rsquo;t much else to say.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Passions         
               and Questors</span><br />We have updated                            and merged the texts found on Barsaive&rsquo;s       
               Passions, and included                            the rules (as well as                            new options) for becoming
               a Questor. The powers have been revised completely, and some have been replaced                                          
               with new ones.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Barsaive</span><br />This                            chapter is
               an extended summary on the lands of Barsaive with the political situation after Prelude to War in mind. The Explorer&rsquo;s
               Guide, the Survival Guide, and the Serpent River sourcebook were used as a guideline. Extended information will be found in
               the Gamemaster&rsquo;s Compendium. The new map uses exiting artwork and was updated with some additional locations from  
               the                            books (the remains of the Kingdom of Marrek, for example, which appeared in Greg Gorden&rsquo;s
               novel Prophecy).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendices</span><br />The                            Appendices
               contains a lot of                            tables and useful sheets: Talents, Talent Knacks, Skills, and Questor       
               Power tables, an Optional Rules Tic-list, Spell tables,                            an extended Characteristics table, a Character
               Creation Summary, a Combat Quick Reference, and new Character Record Sheets.<br /><br /><font size="1">Earthdawn is (c) 2005
