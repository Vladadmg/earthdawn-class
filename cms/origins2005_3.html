               /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 3 - Origins Seminar: July 1, 2005<br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:

               <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Editor&rsquo;s                            Note: </span><span style="font-style:
               italic;">This is a transcript of the seminar given at the 2005 Origins International Game Expo. It is not a word-for-word
               transcription; a lot of the extraneous comments have been cut out (though some have been left in where it fits the flow of
               the text). Part 1 is an introduction and general overview of RedBrick&rsquo;s plans for the line. Part 2 covers the publishing
               model. Part 3 and Part 4 are general Q&amp;A and wrap-up. The format and layout should be self-explanatory, but if you have
               any questions, please feel free to e-mail me or visit one of the Earthdawn web forums linked in this transcript. We try to
               check them daily, and answer questions as quickly as we can. --Josh</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br
               />I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve                                            got heaps of questions, and we should try and cover
               those--as we have only a short time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Yeah, only about ten minutes
               left in here, so let&rsquo;s try and answer whatever                            questions you have at this point.<br /><br
               /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />We&rsquo;ve sort of played a bit of bit of hiding-behind-the-scenes 
               game, as may be apparent                            from the forums. While we&rsquo;ve been trying to be transparent about
               things, we&rsquo;ve probably                                          not been as transparent as we could have been, or should
               have been.<br /><br />Since we were here at Origins,                            and having the books so close to going out
               the door, we thought it would be appropriate to touch base with people, and also                            go ahead and answer
               whatever questions you might have, face to face.<br /><br />To touch back on the forums a                            bit,
               keep in mind that any questions you post there will be answered, just not straightaway.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Josh</span><br />Unless they&rsquo;re really stupid questions, in                            which                
               case we&rsquo;ll just mock you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Yes, that costs nothing.<br
               /><br />It&rsquo;s largely a case                            of time spent answering questions on forums                 
               is time not spent behind a page-layout program, or                            a word processor.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Josh</span><br />Which                            is part of the reason that lately I&rsquo;ve been the more vocal
               one on the                            forums. My work                            at this stage is mostly done; Jim is the
               one scanning and laying out pages. I probably spend more time on                                            the forums than
               I should, since I have three or four more chapters that I need to look at in the player&rsquo;s guide.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />So... any questions?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span><br />What are your
               expected                            release dates?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />The tentative
               plan right now is mid-late August for the player&rsquo;s book, only because while we are pretty much done--all that&rsquo;s
               left is final proofs and a quick polish or two...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Finish the
               index.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />The                            book will have a good index.
               A pet peeve of mine is bad RPG indices. We&rsquo;re taking a page from the previous (and                            current)
               edition of Ars Magica, and will have a separate alphabetical spell index to make finding                            spells
               easier if you don&rsquo;t know                            the Discipline and Circle offhand.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />On top of the quick-reference summaries                            and appendices, all of which will
               be available online as well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Part of the delay is simple turnover.
               We                            have to send it in to Ross at FASA--though he&rsquo;s                            been really
               good at turning things around quickly--he&rsquo;ll take a                            look, say &quot;That&rsquo;s        
               cool, go ahead.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Then it&rsquo;s getting it up to Booksurge.
               They have a two-week--no more than two-week turnaround--for galleys to                            come                   
               back, let us know what it actually looks like. Assuming we get approval, we push the button                            and
               it&rsquo;s available. It&rsquo;s                            all electronic.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />Yeah.                            Once we get the galleys, we tell them to go ahead                            and it&rsquo;s
               available. There&rsquo;s no waiting for the printer, and then                            shipping to                     
               distributors... the book may not be available in shops until September, but it can be ordered online almost as           
               soon as we give them the signal to go.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Another thing to bear
               in mind, if you want to order online, the way Amazon tends to work is offering discounts. One of                         
               the interesting things with this model--and there are variations--is that we really don&rsquo;t care if a vendor or distributor
               discounts. We make what we make on it. All of our margins are based on recommended retail price.<br /><br />We           
               may take a hit in one sense, but at the same time we know exactly what we&rsquo;re up for. It&rsquo;s the same profit    
               for every                            single sale. It&rsquo;s sort of the opposite of the standard model, where you print 
               it as cheaply as possible, and then negotiate                            your discounts You may make only two dollars here,
               but maybe five dollars over here. We can actually plan a bit more effectively,                            from an accounting
               standpoint.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind if you order online, it will actually                               
               be shipped from your local center; Booksurge has outlets in the UK and the Netherlands in Europe, one or two places in the
               United States, Australia, and Japan as well. They have more popping up, so shipping costs will be lower, and the ship time
               will be shorter for &quot;international&quot; sales.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span><br />Will
               you be at GenCon?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Not this year--in large part because we&rsquo;re
               not going to be able to be there. Also, we&rsquo;re not 100%                            sure that                        
               the books will actually be out by then. We&rsquo;ve made some contacts here this                            weekend, and its
               possible that if things go                            really quickly over the next couple of weeks we might              
               have material available at somebody else&rsquo;s booth.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span><br />You
               don&rsquo;t want to go to the trouble                            of getting booth space, arrange distribution            
               and then not have anything?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Exactly. Jim is flying back to New
               Zealand on Monday, Carsten goes back to Germany,                            and I                            don&rsquo;t have
               the time to go and do a major convention alone.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s part of the reason                            we didn&rsquo;t
               get a booth at Origins. There wasn&rsquo;t anything we could do with a booth that we couldn&rsquo;t                      
               do by running                            a few events and hosting a seminar. We didn&rsquo;t have any material available.<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />The other reason to come to                            Origins
               was to see what a big convention was like.                            Dammi and I haven&rsquo;t been to America          
               much, and now we&rsquo;re getting a good firsthand sense of it all. Hopefully we can                            come back
               and do GenCon or the GAMA trade show, or whatever, but that&rsquo;s in the future.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span><br
               />Are there plans to offer electronic versions?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />There are. We
               currently have                                                   an arrangement with DriveThru RPG for the old FASA products.
               Our license with FASA is actually pretty broad. We negotiated                            English-language products worldwide.
               We have a whole bunch of miniatures coming out--we&rsquo;re redoing the old Heartbreaker                            line...<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />All the good                            ones.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />Yes. All the rubbishy                            ones &rsquo;accidentally&rsquo; fell into a vat.
               I&rsquo;ve got ninety ork scorchers on thundra beasts on my shelf                            at home saying,             
               &quot;Paint me!&quot; We&rsquo;re working on the shop for those, so                            they will be available soon.<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span><br />Are pictures of the miniatures available?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />Not yet. I have a digital                            camera at home, so it&rsquo;s just a matter
               of taking the pictures                            and posting them. The minis are important to me--I&rsquo;m             
               a minis gamer as well, and I&rsquo;m                            drafting up some skirmish rules to be used with the minis.
               I picture tribes of orks running                            each                            other down... yeah.<br /><br />The
               reason for this is, again, to drive the ability to create more, original                              miniatures that might
               be more applicable to the line. As with everything else, it&rsquo;s a case of seeing what the demand                     
               really is.<br /><br />We can&rsquo;t do computer games--Microsoft owns those rights--but we can do electronic            
               support                            products, and we&rsquo;ll probably work with guys like Lars Gottlieb and his Second   
               Step program in that area.<br /><br />What else? Plush t&rsquo;skrang toys? Not yet.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Josh</span><br />Though if somebody were interested, we actually have                            the right to negotiate
               sub-licenses.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />That grew from the Drive-Thru deal. While we had
               the                            rights to use the old FASA material to                            create new product, we didn&rsquo;t
               actually have the rights to just reprint the original                            books                            on their
               own. So we negotiated the rights with FASA to do that, and that meant entering into a sub-license agreement              
               with another party--opening up that door as well.<br /><br />We&rsquo;ve had some correspondence with FASA               
               about                            people who are interested in writing modules for the game on their own, and FASA is quite
               happy to deal with them on an individual                            basis, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t step on our toes--or
               LRG&rsquo;s toes--but essentially the gate is open for doing similar                            things if somebody has   
               cool ideas.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span><br />So you                            would be interested
               in hiring people for freelance work?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Absolutely.<br /><br /><span
               style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />That&rsquo;s                            actually one of the things... I keep coming
               back to this. We don&rsquo;t want to be harsh on Living Room Games,                                  but we keep coming back
               to the differences between what we&rsquo;re doing and what they&rsquo;ve done. One of those                            is
               that                            LRG has been rather closed; they have their people, their company, and that&rsquo;s      
               all they use. Which is fine, but not the                            way we want to work.<br /><br />If people            
               want to write stuff for us, fantastic. It means we don&rsquo;t have to.                            We are going to be    
               writing stuff--like I said earlier we&rsquo;ve already got two or three products in the pipe.<br /><br />Honestly        
               though, a few former writers who did stuff for FASA have come back and said, &quot;You guys are doing this?              
               If you want something from me, just let me know.&quot; Steve Kenson, for example. James and Dammi met with him yesterday.<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Steve actually e-mailed us                            after we
               announced the license agreement. So we stalked him here at Origins. But people who have been involved with Earthdawn     
               over the last decade seem to be popping out of the woodwork all the time. Robin Laws...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Josh</span><br />Robin Laws has expressed some interest. Some of these people who got their start                 
               in the mid-90s doing work on Earthdawn are now recognized, award-winning names in the industry/. They&rsquo;re stepping  
               forward                            and saying, &quot;We&rsquo;d love to do this.&quot; Frankly, I geek out a bit         
               and think I&rsquo;m incredibly lucky to                            be a part of this.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />They                            really love the setting--I                            think we all
               love the setting, which is why we&rsquo;re here. The game is great, but some people                                      
               don&rsquo;t like the Step System. The setting is quite important to a lot of us, and we want to see that continue as well.<br
               /><br />Anything else... collectible card games? You&rsquo;re not going to see an Earthdawn CCG anytime soon.<br /><br />
