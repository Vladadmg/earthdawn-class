               <span class="Heading">Campaign Help</span>
               <p>The campaigns section is designed to let you list your campaign on the Earthdawn Classic 
               
               web site and easily share it with people.</p>
               
               <p>To create a new campaign, just choose Add Campaign from the Campaigns menu. It will 
               
               provide you with a series of questions - including who are the players and the game master 
               
               (which will be the first person to add as this is associated with your login). 
               
               </p><img src="/webcms/add-edit-campaign.gif"/>
               <p>Give the Campaign a name for the catalog for people who can see it. A short description 
               
               is given that also appears in the catalog, whereas the longer description appears when then 
               
               go in and see the actual catalog.</p>
               
               <p>You can choose for your campaign to be closed until you have set it up and got 
               
               information into it if you like, but it means that other players who may be members of the 
               
               Earthdawn Classic web site will not be able to associate themselves with your game. You may 
               
               wish to make it open, email them to associate themselves (more on that later) and then make 
               
               it closed. Once they are members of the campaign, they can add items to it (given 
               
               permission) even if it is members only.</p>
               
               <p>There will also be one person automatically added to your campaign - you. Set yourself 
               
               up as the person you play (or gamemaster). You can then add all of the other people in the 
               
               campaign - both in the past and as time goes on. This also serves as a great repository 
               
               when people in your campaign change.</p>
               
               <p>You have a couple of options for members. 
               <ul>
               <li>Active members - this allows you to control whether the member can add anything to the 
               
               journal entries. Thus you may have a person playing in your campaign who is able to add 
               
               entries and over time that person leaves so you can remove their access but still have them 
               
               listed as once having been a member of the campaign.</li>
               <li>Campaign owners are able to create new journals and add new members to the campaign. 
               
               Use this option wisely and don't take yourself off the list otherwise you won't be able to 
               
               get into your campaign any longer.</li>
               </ul>
               </p>
               
               <p><b>Important Note:</b> The system "versions" the descriptions of the characters. What 
               
               this means is that each campaign entry (see below) notes which descriptions it was using 
               
               and always displays the descriptions at that point in time. So you should update their 
               
               descriptions as play causes them to change, advance, go mad, etc as the earlier entries 
               
               will always reflect the character descriptions as at the time the description was made.</p>
               
               <p>Once you have accepted the new Campaign, you can select it in the lists. It will 
               
               automatically be listed as one of your favorites. If you wish to edit it, you can only do 
               
               so from the My Campaigns menu option. Selecting it will bring up a list on the left showing 
               
               the Journals, the Cast (all, past and present - only active members have their name in 
               
               bold) and the entries for the currently selected journal.</p>
               <img src="/webcms/blank-campaign.gif"/>
               <p>If this is the start of your journal entries, you will need to add a journal to 
               
               start.</p><img src="/webcms/add-journal.gif"/>
               <p>Once you have done this, you can decide to add one or more campaign entries to this 
               
               journal. Typically a journal will reflect a single adventure that you have had.</p>
               
               <img src="/webcms/journalsandentries.gif"/>
               <p>When you create a Campaign Entry, you specify when it occured (what day - something that 
               
               makes sense in your campaign) and who was involved. This will determine which members can 
               
               actually add their stories to this campaign entry. A campaign entry contains up to one 
               
               entry for each member of your campaign that you have indicated was there. </p>
               
               <img src="/webcms/add-campaign-entry.gif"/>
               
               <p>Once you had added your campaign entry, you will see that you have an option underneath 
               
               it to say "Add Now" to add your story.</p>
               
               <img src="/webcms/new-campaign-entry-added.gif"/>
               <p>Each entry that a person makes has a subject and a description. The description can be 
               
               up to 10,000 letters (an arbitrary limit, contact the site manager to increase it if 
               
               necessary) and also contain some basic xHTML - such as bolding, simple tables, unnumbered 
               
               lists, and italics.</p>
               
               <img src="/webcms/new-written-entry.gif"/>
               <p>This shows up underneath the campaign entry.</p>
               
               <img src="/webcms/result-of-entry.gif"/>
               <p>You will also see that anyone who has no user associated with them has a link next to it 
               
               saying "This is me!". Clicking on this will send an email to all campaign owners who when 
               
               they come back to the web site - if you choose the Work To Do menu item, you will see an 
               
               option indicating that a particular user wishes to associate themselves with the Cast 
               
               member. You accept or reject this.</p>
