               italic;">This is a transcript of the seminar given at the 2005 Origins International Game Expo. It is not a word-for-word
               transcription; a lot of the extraneous comments have been cut out (though some have been left in where it fits the flow of
               the text). Part 1 is an introduction and general overview of RedBrick&rsquo;s plans for the line. Part 2 covers the publishing
               model. Part 3 and Part 4 are general Q&amp;A and wrap-up. The format and layout should be self-explanatory, but if you have
               any questions, please feel free to e-mail me or visit one of the Earthdawn web forums linked in this transcript. We try to
               check them daily, and answer questions as quickly as we can. --Josh</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br
               />I&rsquo;ll give you a                                                      bit of                            history, because
               it is quite amusing, and that will lead into what the original product                            plan was when we presented
               this to                            FASA/WizKids/FASA.<br /><br />I ran a convention                            a few years
               ago, being an Earthdawn GM from a long way back,                            and at the convention Richard Vowles,        
               a friend of mine, got hooked on it. He had a really good time--obviously I was really                            keen--and
               he brought up the idea of pursuing the Earthdawn license. When I told him that Living Room Games already has an          
               Earthdawn license, he decided he was going to send an e-mail anyway.<br /><br />When FASA shut their doors, most         
               of their intellectual property went over to WizKids--Shadowrun, Battletech, and Earthdawn. We approached WizKids and they
               said, &quot;Yes, you can have the license.&quot; We went through negotiations with WizKids, and after about 6 months     
               we learned the rights for Earthdawn had reverted back to FASA, but that they might still be interested.<br /><br />At that
               point I felt it was going to be too much work, and thought I would go on and do something else like raise children.      
               Richard said, &quot;No, we can do this!&quot; and he sent an e-mail to FASA, and FASA said, &quot;Yeah, we&rsquo;re      
               really keen.&quot; So I was dragged back into the fray.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />By the
               way, when he says FASA, he means Ross Babcock.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Yeah, that&rsquo;s
               pretty much FASA at this point. FASA is still around, but their interests are almost entirely                            in
               intellectual                            property. They&rsquo;re basically just maintaining copyrights and trademarks.<br /><br
               />In October 2003 we announced                            that we had successfully negotiated a license for              
               Earthdawn, and everybody said, &quot;Oh my god! There&rsquo;s going to                            be a third Earthdawn!  
               The moon will fall, and cats will be sleeping with dogs!&quot;<br /><br />The original                                   
               plans were largely to--as Josh described--take the core content, roll it all into a couple of books, chuck it out the door
               and see what happens.<br /><br />What happened over a period of time, unfortunately, was something completely            
               different. &quot;While we&rsquo;re doing it, let&rsquo;s just fix this area here. And this is a bit rubbishy,            
               let&rsquo;s                            do some work there.&quot; And then some more people got involved, like Carlton,   
               and others that aren&rsquo;t here today;                            the whole collective community. We&rsquo;ve ended    
               up with what we&rsquo;ve got here.<br /><br />The publishing model                            that we&rsquo;ve           
               presented is based around print-on-demand. I won&rsquo;t make any bones about that, but it&rsquo;s a little              
               bit different. It&rsquo;s not this sort of print-on-demand. [Indicating mock-up of the EPC] This is not POD, this is puddle.<br
               /><br />The print on demand publisher we&rsquo;re using is Booksurge. Booksurge has recently been purchased by           
               Amazon.com.                            They have a rather unique model in that they have distribution centers around the world.
               So as long as you have an ISBN number,                            you can order product. They have an online shop--as soon
               as the products are listed, they are available through Amazon, Barnes                            &amp; Noble, pretty much
               every online retailer.<br /><br />Booksurge are a print-on-demand publisher, but                            they         
               also have affiliations with major distributors like Alliance and Diamond--at least that is our current understanding.    
               They can source their product directly from Booksurge, and Booksurge will print whatever quantity they desire.<br /><br />The
               reason this is largely experimental is--while places like RPGnow are providing PDFs that can be printed out--we didn&rsquo;t
               want to invest it in the core product lines from the get-go, because there is still an issue of risk because the second edition
               is still out there, and first edition is still being played. It&rsquo;s a conservative thing.<br /><br />So              
               what                            you&rsquo;ll notice is that we haven&rsquo;t really gone ostentatious. We haven&rsquo;t  
               hired the greatest artists, and told                            them &quot;Go forth and create great artwork for us!&quot;
               Yet.<br /><br />If it all goes well, I suspect                            that whatever future edition we release        
               will be like many others out there--perhaps even a color interior with new artwork                            and all the
               cool, funky stuff that goes along with it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />In terms of art, Dammi
               has been fantastic. He&rsquo;s been tracking down some of the original Earthdawn artists--people                         
               like Jeff Laubenstein, who actually mentioned that he might do a promotional piece for us. His prices are a little higher
               than they were ten years ago, but he had a great time working on Earthdawn, and he&rsquo;s keen to get back into it. Several
               other artists as well&hellip;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dammi</span><br />Les Edwards and John Matson gave
               us rights to re-use the cover art.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />One of the more common complaints
               I hear about LRG&rsquo;s stuff relates to                            the                            art; most of it comes
               across with a kind of amateur feel. Not that it&rsquo;s bad--some                            of it is actually pretty good--but
               just the general feel of it isn&rsquo;t consistent with                            the older books. That is something that
               we&rsquo;re going to try and                            avoid; we&rsquo;ll                            try and keep a consistent
               feel with the earlier product.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />The goal is to try and maintain
               the most professional looking products that we                            can, and hopefully                            the
               book meets with your approval in terms of layout and feel. There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that we can                    
               do--I come from a page layout background, and Dammi has a hand in that as well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />I just write stuff.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />There are more arrows in our quiver than
               just taking some games and chucking them together. It&rsquo;s still early                            in                  
               the process.<br /><br />The other part of the business plan was to engage with the                            community more.
               That&rsquo;s                            a two-edged sword, obviously. Fan is short for fanatic, and Earthdawn            
               has a lot of fans. That&rsquo;s meant in a nice way,                            of course.<br /><br />One                
               of the really interesting things--I was chatting with Matt the other day--was you get                            a lot of
               criticism and comments over the boards, aired quite publicly on forums and mailing lists and so forth. We don&rsquo;t    
               really have a problem with critical feedback; that&rsquo;s fine. Normally, if something is in print, it&rsquo;s a        
               bit too late.                            With our print model there&rsquo;s nothing stopping us from fixing errata and   
               the next person that gets the book gets the latest                            one with the errata in it.<br /><br />We have
               to make some conscious decisions with that, because you can upset                            some people if they         
               just bought the book and there&rsquo;s a new version out a week later. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re                
               going to look at more closely once the books are actually done.<br /><br />Print on demand is hellishly flexible.        
               There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff we can do that we couldn&rsquo;t otherwise. We can get just the internals printed out--as   
               a hypothetical                            example --one of the ideas floated as the &quot;leather-bound, limited edition,
               combination player&rsquo;s and GMs guide&quot;.                            One thousand twenty-four pages of role-playing
               goodness.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Suitable for                            use as a doorstop.<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Exactly.                            Throw one of those at your
               players and they&rsquo;ll really feel it.<br /><br />We&rsquo;ve talked                               about customized internals.
               If you&rsquo;re a fan of t&rsquo;skrang, you could have the watermarks all t&rsquo;skrang                            related,
               if you want. We don&rsquo;t care--the content is the same, it&rsquo;s just a theme.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />The other advantage--the one                            that really sold me on getting more involved with              
               this project--is that there isn&rsquo;t a                            lot of capital tied up in product that might not sell.<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />That often kills role-playing companies.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Josh</span><br />Yes, but it also doesn&rsquo;t take as many                            sales to start turning a profit.<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />We&rsquo;re actually pretty open on                           
               this. If we sell about 250 copies, we&rsquo;ve broken even. We encourage everybody                            here to    
               buy twenty copies each.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Most                            small
               press companies do an initial print run of about three thousand copies, and start turning a profit at about              
               twelve hundred sales. But since we aren&rsquo;t tied up in stock--as soon as we break that 250-unit profit line, the money
               can go into other development; paying artists, writers, and things like that. That will actually help cover the higher prices
               of the better artists in the industry.<br />Assuming it works.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br
               />As we&rsquo;ve said, this is all experimental. The philanthropic thing I&rsquo;ve                            been talking
               about on the forums from time to time is trying out this publishing model, see how it works, refine it a bit             
               if necessary, and make the plan a publicly available template in the RPG community.<br /><br />There are a lot           
               of small companies out there that want to do a similar thing, and the technology and infrastructure is in place to make it
               possible now, where it wasn&rsquo;t before. It isn&rsquo;t rocket science, and you don&rsquo;t need a lot--though        
               it is time-intensive.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />And                            paper-intensive.
               I have                            a two-foot stack of printed chapters all marked up in red pen: &quot;This              
               is crap... and this section needs to be over                            here, and this whole chapter needs to be rewritten!&quot;<br
               /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Josh is polite.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />I                            plan to scan                            a few of my marked-up pages and post them online just
               to give people an idea of how much work goes into something                                    like this. A lot of fans don&rsquo;t
               quite realize--I didn&rsquo;t realize, quite honestly--how much work was involved.                            And        
               this was material that was already written for us. Somehow I think that writing original stuff                           
               will be easier.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />[Doubtfully]                            Yeah.<br
               /><br />(General                            laughter)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />It&rsquo;ll
               be different. Let me put it that way.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />We&rsquo;ll reserve judgment
               on that. It&rsquo;ll be an interesting exercise.<br /><br />So, while we&rsquo;re                                        
               apologetic for not having released anything yet, bear in mind this is a learning curve for us, and there are good reasons
               for why we&rsquo;re not rushing it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />We&rsquo;d rather have a
               quality product out there that people are happy with, even if it is six months (or more)                            behind
               our original plan.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Especially                            where
               we have all of this stuff waiting in the wings, ready to go out the door                            on a more regular schedule.<br
