               is a transcript of the seminar given at the 2005 Origins International Game                            Expo. It is not a word-for-word
               transcription; a lot of the extraneous comments have been cut out (though some have been left                            in
               where it fits the flow of the text). Part 1 is an introduction and general overview of RedBrick&rsquo;s plans for the    
               line. Part 2 covers the publishing model. Part 3 and Part 4 are general Q&amp;A and wrap-up. The format and layout should
               be self-explanatory, but if you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me or visit one of the Earthdawn web forums
               linked in this transcript. We try to check them daily, and answer questions as quickly as we can. --Josh</span><br /><br /><span
               style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Welcome to the Future of Earthdawn.                            Pardon us     
               if we seem a little bit excited&hellip; there are a couple copies of the mock-up                            books floating
               around, which we have                            not seen until just now ourselves. There&rsquo;s a bit                  
               of a story about that, and we will share it with people later--just                            ask.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />Preferably over                            a beer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />I&rsquo;m                                         Josh Harrison. I&rsquo;m one of the three lead developers on this project.
               There are other people involved--Carlton [Anderson]                            over there has helped out a bunch, and there
               are a couple of other people who&rsquo;ve helped out who were planning on                            being here, but haven&rsquo;t
               made it yet.<br /><br />This is James Flowers, the head guy, the one indirectly                            responsible for
               this. It&rsquo;s Richard&rsquo;s fault, really, but James is the one here.<br /><br />At                            the end
               of the table is Carsten Damm. The three of us have been involved with Earthdawn--I think our collective experience       
               is close to thirty years with the game.<br /><br />So... Earthdawn Classic. What we&rsquo;ve done is taken               
               all of the original material that FASA put out from 1993 to 1998, and originally the plan was to slap it all into a book and
               put it out. We ended up discovering it was going to be a bit more difficult than we originally thought. At one point, we were
               doing so many adjustments and changes it looked like we were going to end up with a completely new &quot;third edition&quot;
               of the game, instead of what we finally ended up with.<br /><br />There are still tentative plans for a third            
               edition, but that&rsquo;s down the road. At some point we will probably do that, and Carsten is in charge of the early   
               stages of that project. But that&rsquo;s three or four years down the road--if it&rsquo;s something we actually end      
               up doing.<br /><br />Earthdawn Player&rsquo;s CompendiumFirst up we have the Player&rsquo;s Compendium                   
               [Click on the thumbnail for the full image], which will be 512 pages, hardcover, which contains everything a player needs
               to take their character from first through fifteenth Circle, covering the core fifteen Disciplines of the game. All the spells,
               all the rules, everything from the whole line. Most of the material in the Player&rsquo;s Compendium is from the original
               book, Earthdawn Companion, Arcane Mysteries, The Adept&rsquo;s Way, and Magic: Manual of Mystic Secrets. Most of the setting
               books didn&rsquo;t make it in there. We have some material from the Denizens books, as well.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s       
               a collection, it&rsquo;s a polish, of the core rules for the game--again, drawing on thirty collective years of experience,
               along with feedback from the fanbase--areas where we know there were problems in the original system and fixing those. Where
               we have made changes, we&rsquo;ve tried to have the original rules there as an option, to make compatibility with other  
               editions easier.<br /><br />Earthdawn Gamemaster&rsquo;s CompendiumThen we have the Gamemaster&rsquo;s                   
               Compendium [Click on the thumbnail for the full image], which has much the same idea. It pulls on a lot more of the setting
               material; Creatures of Barsaive, Horrors, most of the magical treasures from the original book, Arcane Mysteries, and Magic.
               The Earthdawn Survival Guide has a lot of material in there, as does the Barsaive boxed set--both the player&rsquo;s and 
               gamemaster&rsquo;s book from that are in there. This book will also be a 512-page hardcover.<br /><br />With             
               those two books, you have over a thousand pages of material; enough stuff to run games for years. You really wouldn&rsquo;t
               need to pick anything else up.<br /><br />Unless you like us and want to give us money, which we have no problem         
               with.<br /><br />For me, this has been a labor of love. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of this game from the earliest             
               days, and the opportunity to go through and give it the polish and treatment I felt it deserved&hellip; it&rsquo;s       
               been a lot of work. Eighteen months and counting, now? We&rsquo;re looking at publication of the Player&rsquo;s Compendium
               in August, and the Gamemaster&rsquo;s Compendium in late September, possibly October. I&rsquo;m taking the GM book       
               home with me and I&rsquo;m going to sit down with a red pen and mark it all to hell.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">James</span><br />It&rsquo;ll be ready in October.<br /><br />(Laughter)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />Okay, yes,                                            I am a slow editor, I admit that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:
               bold;">Question</span><br />This year?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />Yes,                 
               October of this year.<br /><br />Lined up in the pipe are two or three adventures more or less ready                     
               to go, we&rsquo;ve just been waiting on the core rules. We&rsquo;ve got Ardanyan&rsquo;s Revenge, an adventure           
               that Dammi has written. Burning Desires, by Andrew Ragland. I&rsquo;ve got an adventure currently in outline form called 
               Pilgrimage.<br /><br />Pilgrimage is probably going to be a combination introductory adventure and quick-start           
               setting that is still in Barsaive, but separate from the whole Throal/Bartertown/Theran War storyline. This is so new players
               to the game don&rsquo;t feel intimidated by all the backstory and metaplot that was going on.<br /><br />Our             
               plans are to follow the trend started recently by White Wolf and Atlas Games, and go all hardcover for our print runs. Ardanyan&rsquo;s
               Revenge may end up as a softcover--there are practical limits to making a 48-page hardcover,after all, but we are going to
               try and have enough material in these books to justify making them hardcover. [Ed note: The 48-page reference is about the
               practicality of thin hardcovers, and not an actual page count on Ardanyan&rsquo;s Revenge.] James will talk about the    
               publishing model we&rsquo;re using in a minute--it&rsquo;s kind of an experiment.<br /><br />If you don&rsquo;t          
               already know, our website is www.earthdawn-classic.com. We&rsquo;re working on getting earthdawn.com from Keith Graham,  
               who currently holds the domain--he&rsquo;s been incommunicado for a few weeks now traveling, but the last answer we had  
               from him was a yes, so it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.<br /><br />There&rsquo;s a really active fan                    
               forum over at the Earthdawn Publishing Trust--www.edpt.org--a lot of great material and support there. Even the Living Room
               Games board, when its active, has some good stuff.<br /><br />As far as LRG goes... they will put out their stuff,       
               and we&rsquo;ll put out ours. You can pick and choose--use ours, use theirs, use both, use neither, whatever. We wish    
               them luck, and assume to a certain extent they wish us the same. There&rsquo;s no animosity or a sense that we&rsquo;re  
               going to try and take them down or anything.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Not at all. I chat
               with Joe Chan, who                            used to be president of LRG. He&rsquo;s a nice guy,                        
               and we have interesting idle banter.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />James knows more about the
               publishing model, so I&rsquo;m going to turn things over to him, and then we&rsquo;ll                            open the
               floor up to questions and see where that leads us.<br /><font size="1"><br /></font>
