               <br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Editor's Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">This is
               a transcript of the seminar given at the 2005 Origins International Game Expo. It is not a word-for-word transcription; a
               lot of the extraneous comments have been cut out (though some have been left in where it fits the flow of the text). Part
               1 is an introduction and general overview of RedBrick&rsquo;s plans for the line. Part 2 covers the publishing model. Part
               3 and Part 4 are general Q&amp;A and wrap-up. The format and layout should be self-explanatory, but if you have any questions,
               please feel free to e-mail me or visit one of the Earthdawn web forums linked in this transcript. We try to check them daily,
               and answer questions as quickly as we can. --Josh</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />If at
               all.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />Yeah. I just make them and build a big bonfire, adding
               some petrol, maybe.<br /><br />What else? I guess we should briefly talk about what we talked about with Lou.<br /><br /><span
               style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />We met with Lou Prosperi this                            past Tuesday, and &rsquo;wasted&rsquo;
               about two hours of Lou going through the GM&rsquo;s book and asking questions about what                            we were
               doing, and what he thought about some of the stuff he saw.<br /><br />Then we more or less covered the                   
               history of what they were planning, and why they were planning it, and how that related to what Living Room Games put out...<br
               /><br />Actually, that reminds me... I want to mention Barsaive at War.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />This is something that
               we&rsquo;ve been going back and forth on.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br />This is where I eat
               crow.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br />The legendary supplement, Barsaive at War, was in the pipe
               when FASA stopped the                            line. I think it&rsquo;s the reason why the game continued on as this cult
               thing. It&rsquo;s like if Episode III never came                            out; there would be this massive cliffhanger,
               with all sorts of people upset and crying, &quot;We want to know what happens                            next!&quot; I really
               think that&rsquo;s why, within a certain circle of the community anyway, the game really continued                       
               on.<br /><br />Living Room Games did their version a couple of years ago. At this point, it&rsquo;s come out, so         
               I&rsquo;ve been asking myself, do we do our own version? Do we say, &quot;The events that are described have happened,&quot;
               and set our line after that point, including the relevant information in the history chapter? The war happened, here&rsquo;s
               the aftermath, and now we&rsquo;re starting off after that. Or...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">James</span><br
               />Make up something else entirely with lots of windlings in it?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh</span><br
               />Do we put out what FASA (and Lou) intended?                            Do we do our own take on it? This is really where
               we want to hear the feedback from the fan community; would people like to                            see something like that?<br
               /><br />I mean, the LRG version is out, and I think that people know what was intended--in                            the
               core fan community anyway. There have been a bunch of discussions about what was originally planned, what was put out    
               by LRG, and so forth--and people have the material to do it themselves if they want.<br /><br />Just as an informal      
               poll here, is this something you&rsquo;d like to see? This is something we were looking at, but have realized that this may
               not be something we need to sink development time and money into. Would you rather see original stuff, would you rather see
               more compilations of older material? We&rsquo;ve discussed packages like the Throal Sourcebook and the Serpent River together
               in a single hardcover, perhaps including Throal Adventures as well.<br /><br />We actually need to get going here,       
               so the next group can set up, but we&rsquo;ll be hanging out in the hallway after this, so please, let us know what you&rsquo;d
               like to see. After the core books and the first two or three supplements, we&rsquo;re not exactly sure where we&rsquo;re going
               to go, and we&rsquo;d like to at least get some idea of what the fans want to see.<br /><br />Obviously, we&rsquo;re     
               aware that the people who actually tell us anything are only a small sample of the whole community.<br /><br />Anyway,   
               thank for coming out. If you want to keep talking to us, we&rsquo;re happy to ramble on for hours, but we need to open the
               room up for the next group. Thanks again.
