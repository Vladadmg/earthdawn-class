                     <td width="100%" align="left" class="TableCell">How did I get into this Earthdawn thing? Well, I've been a Gamemaster since I was 11; started off with boxed Dungeons and
                        Dragons and then moved to Chivalry and Sorcery, DragonQuest, Tunnels and Trolls, RuneQuest -- the usual suspects, other than
                        Dungeons and Dragons. Being a player was (and still is) a rare thing, although I did pick up an award for top player in a
                        convention in the '80s. Nostalgic memory there... *smile*
                        
                        
                        <p>On to Earthdawn. This game I discovered on its release. One of the few shops stocking roleplaying games in New Zealand had
                           a copy, plus the Barsaive boxed set and Mists of Betrayal. I paid the money, and got an addiction in return. Looking back,
                           I'm not sure what it was about the game that appealed so much. I mean, personally, I had GM'd so many games over the years
                           that the prospect of another was, well, no big deal. But I read the core rulebook and was hooked.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>You see, for me, I've always wanted to run a game that allowed flexibility in every area I wanted to run in: horror, politics,
                           dungeon crawls, big sweeping vistas -- the "Gone With The Wind" of roleplaying games.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Don't get me wrong: there are a lot of games that can claim this crown. But I wanted something that "made sense" (to me, anyway)
                           and that's where the ED game appealed. Was Earthdawn, the game, designed from the outset to illicit this sort of emotion?
                           I suspect not. But it did. And it stuck. And I took the time out to introduce my players to it, and they liked it, and it
                           stuck with them. So much so, in fact, that it is now (officially) the longest running campaign we have run to date.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Anyway, rant mode aside, on to how this became the focus of RedBrick. Richard Vowles (my business partner and occasional conscience
                           *grin*) attended a convention at which I ran a series of Earthdawn games: nothing major, just a trio of sessions that effectively
                           formed a "contiguous ED session." But I must have struck a nerve (probably that near encounter with the wormskull), because
                           he was impressed enough to start collecting ED books -- everything Richard could get his hands on, including one of my spare
                           sets of books -- and then came up with the idea of approaching Wizkids (who had the rights at the time) for an ED license.
                           I confess I laughed at the idea. Although I had been running my own Jamesdawn "House Rules" variant for a while, the idea
                           of actually getting a license seemed, well, kinda far-fetched, to be honest. Boy, was I surprised when Wizkids came back with
                           a "show us what you are proposing" response. At this point things started getting a little more serious...
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>I don't know how you all approach life, the universe and everything (sic), but I have some clear goals in my life. One of
                           these has always been to turn my hobby into a career. Like many people, I have entertained the idea of becoming the "next
                           big thing" in writing -- churning out novels at a frenetic pace, and having publishers approach me in droves, all vying for
                           my business and attention. However, being a Cancerian, and therefore somewhat  (yeah, right!) conservative in my approach
                           to things, the likelihood of this happening was, well, remote; maybe until I had retired, anyway. I digress...
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>So, Richard had pushed the button, Wizkids had answered, and we needed to consider whether we were seriously going to pursue
                           this license. Richard asked me what I thought. I thought a lot about it (as one should). And my first thought was, "OK. Yes.
                           Why not?" So that's where we started. More on this later...
                        </p>
