                        least) monthly updates on my blog, so you can expect more of these going forwards. If we appear to be less than communicative
                        of late, I can only be the one to shoulder the blame for that; because I have been so "face down, bum up" (as we say here),
                        it hasn't left much time for forum postings, decent responses to emails, or much else.
                        
                        
                        <p>Richard has been kept busy tweaking the forums and underlying content management system that drives the web site, and working
                           with artists for materials based around the Earthdawn Shards. Plus he has been getting some Shards into an almost completed
                           state. (Well, he would have a couple completed already if I didn't keep sticking my nose in! *laugh*) I have been well and
                           truly occupied with books -- editing, writing, scanning, image editing, cross-referencing, and a whole lot more. I even managed
                           to crank out a draft layout, using the opening "Inheritance" chapter, as a mockup for one possible book interior "look". Once
                           I have some better artwork for this, we'll look at posting a couple of versions on the web site so you can get a taste of
                           what the new books will look like. On top of all this is the administrative elements, for which we have been doing some "other
                           stuff" (yes, Earthdawn-related), the results of which will become evident over the next few months.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>There is a *lot* to do -- a lot more than I thought when we first looked at this licence -- and the workload doesn't seem
                           to get smaller! My wife and family think I am glued to my chair, as each time they wander past the home office where I spend
                           the majority of my time, I'm always "stuck" there. They have been extremely supportive, as have Richard's family, and we are
                           blessed in that regard. Thankfully, we are also working with some great people at the moment, who are volunteering a lot of
                           their time assisting us with "things Earthdawn". For the record, I am *extremely* grateful for the assistance we have received
                           to date; without it, we would not be as far along the track as we are now! And that thanks extends to those of you who have
                           taken the time in email and on forums to offer assistance. We haven't forgotten that you have asked, but for the moment there
                           are advantages in keeping the development group smaller and tighter. Your time will come, don't worry... *grin*
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>We are striving to move into Playtest mode as quickly as possible. However, the two main rulebooks are taking a lot longer
                           to get ready than we anticipated. This is not due to a lack of activity, but more the amount of work required to ensure that
                           everything brought together from the existing supplements is consistent across the books. This is in terms of phrasing, style,
                           referencing, modifiers, examples -- the whole gamut. And it goes beyond the books in establishing a style that will bring
                           that same consistency into all of our products. A lot of different writers have contributed content to the Earthdawn game
                           over the years; add to this the amount of QandA and errata, plus all the new content, and there is a major piece of work involved
                           in getting this completed. Our focus at present is on the Player's Compendium, although we certainly haven't forgotten the
                           Gamemaster's Compendium, or the other books. We have recently updated the Publications Roster with additional books and a
                           status indicator to show what is In Progress. This should give you an idea of what's "on the boil". However, it doesn't show
                           you what's due out and when; as soon as we can give a firm date, we will. I'll be direct here and say that I'm not confident
                           we'll have the first books out this year (contrary to posts on one of the EDC forums). That's not what we intended or wanted,
                           but, for my part, I want to make sure that the Player's and Gamemaster's Compendiums are as good as we can get them. These
                           will be the books referenced by all of the new, original content, books in progress at the moment, so they are kind of important
                           in that respect. That and I'd rather not have to go through a rework of them again any time soon. Down that path lies insanity...
                           *smile*
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The Player's Compendium is currently running at around 420 draft pages. This includes edit notes for playtesters and a detailed
                           Contents section, but excludes an Index, Character Record Sheet, Compiled Tables, Map, and artwork. Best estimates for final
                           typeset page count at the moment would be closer to 500 pages for this book (no, that's not a typo). Currently there are 23
                           chapters in the "tome", combining the majority of the player-related content from the following FASA books and supplements:
                           ED Rulebook, ED Companion, Arcane Mysteries of Barsaive, Magic: A Manual of Mystic Secrets, and The Adept's Way. Some content
                           from other supplements, such as Crystal Raiders of Barsaive, ED Survival Guide, Orks of Cara Fahd, Serpent River, Denizens
                           I and II, and the Barsaive Boxed Set, plus several adventures are also included in here. On top of this, there is a considerable
                           amount of new content, in the form of expanded+errata'd+QandA'd content and a lot of optional rules intended to expand the
                           scope of the game, without breaking compatibility with previous products. Almost every piece of text has been looked at, reviewed,
                           kept intact, reworded or discarded. In the Player's Compendium, that's currently 426,200 words as I write this. There's more
                           work to do yet.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The Gamemaster's Compendium is currently running at around 350 draft pages, as per the comments on the Player's Compendium,
                           above. Best estimates for final typeset page count at the moment would be around 450 pages for this book. Because it contains
                           the bestiary and legendary treasures, the artwork will be greater in this book, so the page count may increase from this.
                           Currently there are 24 chapters in this book, combining the majority of the gamemaster-related content, including most of
                           the background "fluff" text, from the following FASA books and supplements: ED Rulebook, ED Companion, Arcane Mysteries of
                           Barsaive, Magic: A Manual of Mystic Secrets, Creatures of Barsaive, Horrors, Crystal Raiders of Barsaive, Serpent River, Orks
                           of Cara Fahd, the Barsaive Boxed Set, Dragons, Blood Wood, the Parlainth Boxed Set, and a whole lot more. This book is getting
                           some increased attention at the moment, and while I've not yet reviewed the entire content yet, but I'm getting there. 357,016
                           words at time of writing this, and likely to increase.

                        <p>The next RedBrick Update will focus on more of the details of what's "new" in the Player's Compendium, but to kick this first
                           RedBrick update off I thought I'd start with a "general" what is in the EDC books spiel. Caveat: this is all subject to Playtester
                           feedback, and may change, but since I've been slack in letting you know just what's going on, you may as well know how things
                           stand for the moment.
