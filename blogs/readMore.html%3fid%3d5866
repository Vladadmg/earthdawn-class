                        a straight-forward task has turned into a major one. When we looked at the Earthdawn products, our first thought was "compile
                        this into fewer volumes." That, we thought, would be a simple job. Take what FASA had already published in a number of supplements,
                        compile the content into a logical sequence, freshen up the content with FAQ and errata, and voila! Alas no, this has proved
                        to be not so easy.
                        
                        
                        <p>On the <a href="http://earthdawn.werg.net/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=254" target="_blank">WERG forums</a>, what seems a long tme ago now, I posted a dissertation (read: a rant) about our design "sacred cows" -- some of the things
                           that we wanted to achieve with the FASA-produced material. At the time this seemed like a noble ideal. And it still is --
                           in principle, anyway.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>The main issue we have struck to date is not that of compiling existing content. Nor the sheer volume of content to deal with
                           (remembering we're playing with 7 years of FASA content here). The biggest problem to date has been to ensure that things
                           are presented "consistently," and that has meant looking at the wording of virtually everything and making sure it matches
                           up with both the intent of the original writer and that of comparable mechanics. As I write this blog entry, I am wading through
                           the spell descriptions in the Player's Compendium. A quick count ... there are 473 spells in the draft Player's Compendium
                           at the moment, spread over the four primary magical Disciplines. One thing that strikes me is that there must have been a
                           number of different authors working on these spells; something I had never considered in 10 years of Earthdawn gaming was
                           consistency of spell effects. For some reason, it never came up in my games. But with a writer's (and editor's) critical eye,
                           there's a lot of differences in what is presented.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Let's hark back to the Earthdawn Classic ideas. You've all read the forum thread on WERG about sacred cows? Excellent! Moo!
                           Let's continue. We are really very keen to take what FASA has produced and compile it into a comprehensive whole. And a major
                           component of this is ensuring we keep as close as possible to what we think (and with people like Lou Prosperi's assistance,
                           we're pretty sure) FASA would have liked to have done if they had revised what was already out in print. That means backwards
                           compatibility with existing material, but ensuring we put some hooks in place now to incorporate add-ins further on that will
                           add to the game line as a whole and take it in newer directions. It is, after all, a flexible game system.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>So we've compiled a huge quantity of textual content. Now we're working to massage this content, bringing our own touch to
                           the game, and incorporating the feedback and comments from a number of people who have been actively involved with the game
                           since it's release. Once we're past this phase, we will move the drafts out to the playtesters. Their job is extremely valuable,
                           and I suspect some of them may not be aware of how hard they are going to be pushed for feedback and comments.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>I'm still not sure what sort of commentary you would all like me to post on these blogs, so please do take the time to leave
                           me some comments. Otherwise, I'll cut this short and blog on another time. A parting comment: currently, the Player's Compendium
                           draft is 386 pages without graphics or an index. We projected a book probably around 450 pages, so this is looking to be the
                           case. Back to the keyboard!
