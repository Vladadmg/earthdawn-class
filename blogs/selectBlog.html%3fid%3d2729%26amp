                        <div>I have had quite a break, I had some time off - bit of a burn out but I have been spending some hours putting together some
                           material for the Shards group. The biggest problem I have is the stats for NPCs - they just take <i>way</i> too long to lay out, so I will be putting together a simple app to get people to enter them into there and then I can auto-generate
                           the layout making that whole portion of it simple and easy and <b>standard</b>. 
                           
                           The first Shard in the list is making its way much closer to release now, I would expect it out within a couple of weeks -
                           FASA willing.

                        <div>It has been a hectic couple of weeks for me, my company sent me out of town and I had to stay at an apartment that had no
                           internet and work on premisis where I wasn't allowed to plug in so I have been pretty much internet-less for the last little
                           while.
                           
                           Things are starting to progress again now though, I have more artwork so I will be working with the Shards developers on starting
                           to progress a number more of those in the next week. Unfortunately, it looks like after next week I may be out again for a
                           week, but such is life!
                           
                           Enjoy your weekend those who are just starting it!

                        </div>
                        <div>I have been working on the Shards project for the last few days. The first attempt I put up required some interesting changes
                           - I use the Willow font as the main headlining font and Papyrus to announce its name and Georgia for the body text. It didn't
                           work out so well, so now eveything is Papyrus (headline + title) and Palintino Linotype (James' suggestion) and it looks pretty
                           good. 
                           <p></p>
                           
                           I also changed the background from the attack on a lonely road to the party looking out across a valley from a lonely ruin.
                           I don't have the second image in very high resolution and it clearly isn't finally done (its in pencil, Paul who works for
                           Weta as his day job and is pretty busy has yet to ink it). 
                           <p></p>
                           
                           But I have found it may take a while to get the layout quite right. One other thing we are doing is simple caricatures of
                           important NPCs for all of our material. The images aren't fantastic quality, but they do convey the essence of an NPC, at
                           least, I hope :-)
                           <p></p>
                           
                           Thats all for this long Queens Birthday weekend, I am just waiting on some confirmation from James that I got a migration
                           from 3rd circle Elf Troubadour to 4th circle Human troubadour right before I update the PDF again for those on the Shards
                           project. Then I need the final art from Paul, and then when it is accepted by James, it goes into the hands of FASA and then
                           onto the web site for final delivery. Hopefully that will be sooner than a few weeks away!

                        <div>I had a number of other web sites that use the same framework that I had to iron out, as well as some little databasey issues
                           and error logging which was the biggest pain.
                           
                           I have a couple more tweaks to make to the web site in terms of syndication (I want to syndicate the rpgcampaigns and the
                           forums) and then I will be moving onto my duties in the Shards and Compact Edition areas as our artists are really coming

                        <div>Sorry for the up and down on the web site - it'll probably go on for another hour or so while i figure out the kinks. The
                           intention is to make the process of deploying new functionality less time consuming and less likely to take the web site down
                           for too long. I have created a staging area that will hold all the updates and then deployment is simply a web server down
                           / copy / web server up. But making sure I have all the right bits deployed...
                           
                           Thats what I'm working on now!
