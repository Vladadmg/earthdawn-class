                        </div>
                        <div>Well, the last month has definitely been one of consolidation and integration. This is the first of what I intend to be (at
                           least) monthly updates on my blog, so you can expect more of these going forwards. If we appear to be less than communicative
                           of late, I can only be the one to shoulder the blame for that; because I have been so "face down, bum up" (as we say here),
                           it hasn't left much time for forum postings, decent responses to emails, or much else.
                           
                           
                           <p>Richard has been kept busy tweaking the forums and underlying content management system that drives the web site, and working
                              with artists for materials based around the Earthdawn Shards. Plus he has been getting some Shards into an almost completed
                              state. (Well, he would have a couple completed already if I didn't keep sticking my nose in! *laugh*) I have been well and
                              truly occupied with books -- editing, writing, scanning, image editing, cross-referencing, and a whole lot more. I even managed
                              to crank out a draft layout, using the opening "Inheritance" chapter, as a mockup for one possible book interior "look". Once
                              I have some better artwork for this, we'll look at posting a couple of versions on the web site so you can get a taste of
                              what the new books will look like. On top of all this is the administrative elements, for which we have been doing some "other
                              stuff" (yes, Earthdawn-related), the results of which will become evident over the next few months.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>There is a *lot* to do -- a lot more than I thought when we first looked at this licence -- and the workload doesn't seem
                              to get smaller! My wife and family think I am glued to my chair, as each time they wander past the home office where I spend
                              the majority of my time, I'm always "stuck" there. They have been extremely supportive, as have Richard's family, and we are
                              blessed in that regard. Thankfully, we are also working with some great people at the moment, who are volunteering a lot of
                              their time assisting us with "things Earthdawn". For the record, I am *extremely* grateful for the assistance we have received
                              to date; without it, we would not be as far along the track as we are now! And that thanks extends to those of you who have
                              taken the time in email and on forums to offer assistance. We haven't forgotten that you have asked, but for the moment there
                              are advantages in keeping the development group smaller and tighter. Your time will come, don't worry... *grin*
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>We are striving to move into Playtest mode as quickly as possible. However, the two main rulebooks are taking a lot longer
                              to get ready than we anticipated. This is not due to a lack of activity, but more the amount of work required to ensure that
                              everything brought together from the existing supplements is consistent across the books. This is in terms of phrasing, style,
                              referencing, modifiers, examples -- the whole gamut. And it goes beyond the books in establishing a style that will bring
                              that same consistency into all of our products. A lot of different writers have contributed content to the Earthdawn game
                              over the years; add to this the amount of QandA and errata, plus all the new content, and there is a major piece of work involved
                              in getting this completed. Our focus at present is on the Player's Compendium, although we certainly haven't forgotten the
                              Gamemaster's Compendium, or the other books. We have recently updated the Publications Roster with additional books and a
                              status indicator to show what is In Progress. This should give you an idea of what's "on the boil". However, it doesn't show
                              you what's due out and when; as soon as we can give a firm date, we will. I'll be direct here and say that I'm not confident
                              we'll have the first books out this year (contrary to posts on one of the EDC forums). That's not what we intended or wanted,
                              but, for my part, I want to make sure that the Player's and Gamemaster's Compendiums are as good as we can get them. These
                              will be the books referenced by all of the new, original content, books in progress at the moment, so they are kind of important
                              in that respect. That and I'd rather not have to go through a rework of them again any time soon. Down that path lies insanity...
                              *smile*
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>The Player's Compendium is currently running at around 420 draft pages. This includes edit notes for playtesters and a detailed
                              Contents section, but excludes an Index, Character Record Sheet, Compiled Tables, Map, and artwork. Best estimates for final
                              typeset page count at the moment would be closer to 500 pages for this book (no, that's not a typo). Currently there are 23
                              chapters in the "tome", combining the majority of the player-related content from the following FASA books and supplements:
                              ED Rulebook, ED Companion, Arcane Mysteries of Barsaive, Magic: A Manual of Mystic Secrets, and The Adept's Way. Some content
                              from other supplements, such as Crystal Raiders of Barsaive, ED Survival Guide, Orks of Cara Fahd, Serpent River, Denizens
                              I and II, and the Barsaive Boxed Set, plus several adventures are also included in here. On top of this, there is a considerable
                              amount of new content, in the form of expanded+errata'd+QandA'd content and a lot of optional rules intended to expand the
                              scope of the game, without breaking compatibility with previous products. Almost every piece of text has been looked at, reviewed,
                              kept intact, reworded or discarded. In the Player's Compendium, that's currently 426,200 words as I write this. There's more
                              work to do yet.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>The Gamemaster's Compendium is currently running at around 350 draft pages, as per the comments on the Player's Compendium,
                              above. Best estimates for final typeset page count at the moment would be around 450 pages for this book. Because it contains
                              the bestiary and legendary treasures, the artwork will be greater in this book, so the page count may increase from this.
                              Currently there are 24 chapters in this book, combining the majority of the gamemaster-related content, including most of
                              the background "fluff" text, from the following FASA books and supplements: ED Rulebook, ED Companion, Arcane Mysteries of
                              Barsaive, Magic: A Manual of Mystic Secrets, Creatures of Barsaive, Horrors, Crystal Raiders of Barsaive, Serpent River, Orks
                              of Cara Fahd, the Barsaive Boxed Set, Dragons, Blood Wood, the Parlainth Boxed Set, and a whole lot more. This book is getting
                              some increased attention at the moment, and while I've not yet reviewed the entire content yet, but I'm getting there. 357,016
                              words at time of writing this, and likely to increase.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>The next RedBrick Update will focus on more of the details of what's "new" in the Player's Compendium, but to kick this first
                              RedBrick update off I thought I'd start with a "general" what is in the EDC books spiel. Caveat: this is all subject to Playtester
                              feedback, and may change, but since I've been slack in letting you know just what's going on, you may as well know how things
                              stand for the moment.

                        </div>
                        <div>I've just posted a new update to the pre-playtest group. Things are getting so close to playtest for the Player's Compendium
                           now that I am getting kind of excited. Of course, I had high hopes that we would have been at this stage a few months ago.
                           Why hasn't this been the case? Well, it's not from working hard at this venture.
                           
                           <p>There is a lot of truth in the 80/20 rule. You know the one. "80 percent of the work goes into the last 20 percent of the
                              project." Unfortunately, this is the case with the revised books as well. If it had been simply a case of taking the original
                              content, shoving it around in a wordprocessor, slapping a coat of paint on it and pushing it out the door, then we would have
                              been there by now. Unfortunately, I have this little problem called "pride" that gets in the way of doing things this way.
                              Not the vain version of pride. Pride in having the opportunity to publish materials for my favorite fantasy game. And with
                              that pride comes "responsibility" -- and that means taking the time to produce the absolute best books that I possibly can.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>How much effort does it take? Well, if we had the resources of a company like Hasbro, then we could afford to hire people
                              full-time to work on these projects. That doesn't mean we don't have resources, just that we don't have the luxury of eating
                              into them to produce books. So we throw time at this instead -- full-time commitment from me and the other RedBrick staff,
                              part-time commitment from our kind volunteers. I've had a couple of emails from people wondering how things are going, and
                              wondering about the state of the nation in the Earthdawn Classic world. Well, we're making steady progress toward the first
                              releases. And, they will be ready when they're ready. That hopefully still means 2004. But if it isn't, then please don't
                              be disappointed. It's not just one or two books we're talking about here...
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>When is enough, enough? At this stage, when we get to playtest and the playtesters come back with a resounding "cool" ...</p>

                        </div>
                        <div>One of the new additions to the Compendiums is a Glossary of terms referenced in the Earthdawn rules. At present, this is
                           being worked on and added to as we work through the rules: adding an entry here, trying to provide a concise description for
                           that term, and cross-referencing as we go.
                           
                           <p>A thought struck me this evening as I added descriptions for another half-dozen terms. "Why not open this part of the project
                              up to the Earthdawn community?" While I see the Glossary as a useful (and essential) addition to the comprehensive tomes we
                              are working on, it also has value as a supplement in its own right; and likely for both editions of the Earthdawn game as
                              well.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>So my line of thinking is, when I get back from holiday in a few weeks time, I might just PDF the current "Glossary in Progress"
                              and post it up to the EDC site so that you, as fans, can add your piece to the new rulebooks. Thoughts and comments welcomed
                              on this idea, either replying to this blog posting, or on the Product Development Forum.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>There is a caveat: while we won't be giving away free stuff to those who help with this, and there won't be a financial payment,

                        <div>Well, that was a lovely little interlude. Now, back into the real world of Earthdawn. I am currently working on the Player's
                           Compendium. Once we get the next build up for peer review, I am hoping to get this out to the playtesters so it can be disseminated,

                        <div>Nothing much to report today. Spent some time with my three boys mastering the fine arts of Playstation and PC gaming. I've
                           never been big on computer gaming, so this doesn't come naturally to me. (OK, when I was a teenager video games were a BIG
                           THING, but that's a long time ago we're talking about here.) There's something quite refreshing about watching youths puzzle
                           their way through things we take for granted, solving puzzles, jumping virtual chasms, toasting pixelized monsters. I guess
                           that's one of the secret pleasures of being a parent -- trying to recapture some of the wonder of being young where we can.
                           
                           <p>Doesn't roleplaying engender some of these feelings as well? I have this vision of my retirement, sitting in my apartment
                              or house or room in the retirement home with my friends, still gaming away; more-so because we'll actually have time in which
                              to do it in! Mind you, trying to read the numbers on the dice could prove to be a little interesting...

                        </div>
                        <div>Continuing work on getting the Player's Compendium ready for playtest. It's still amazing to me how what I thought would be
                           a straight-forward task has turned into a major one. When we looked at the Earthdawn products, our first thought was "compile
                           this into fewer volumes." That, we thought, would be a simple job. Take what FASA had already published in a number of supplements,
                           compile the content into a logical sequence, freshen up the content with FAQ and errata, and voila! Alas no, this has proved
                           to be not so easy.
                           
                           
                           <p>On the <a href="http://earthdawn.werg.net/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=254" target="_blank">WERG forums</a>, what seems a long tme ago now, I posted a dissertation (read: a rant) about our design "sacred cows" -- some of the things
                              that we wanted to achieve with the FASA-produced material. At the time this seemed like a noble ideal. And it still is --
                              in principle, anyway.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>The main issue we have struck to date is not that of compiling existing content. Nor the sheer volume of content to deal with
                              (remembering we're playing with 7 years of FASA content here). The biggest problem to date has been to ensure that things
                              are presented "consistently," and that has meant looking at the wording of virtually everything and making sure it matches
                              up with both the intent of the original writer and that of comparable mechanics. As I write this blog entry, I am wading through
                              the spell descriptions in the Player's Compendium. A quick count ... there are 473 spells in the draft Player's Compendium
                              at the moment, spread over the four primary magical Disciplines. One thing that strikes me is that there must have been a
                              number of different authors working on these spells; something I had never considered in 10 years of Earthdawn gaming was
                              consistency of spell effects. For some reason, it never came up in my games. But with a writer's (and editor's) critical eye,
                              there's a lot of differences in what is presented.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Let's hark back to the Earthdawn Classic ideas. You've all read the forum thread on WERG about sacred cows? Excellent! Moo!
                              Let's continue. We are really very keen to take what FASA has produced and compile it into a comprehensive whole. And a major
                              component of this is ensuring we keep as close as possible to what we think (and with people like Lou Prosperi's assistance,
                              we're pretty sure) FASA would have liked to have done if they had revised what was already out in print. That means backwards
                              compatibility with existing material, but ensuring we put some hooks in place now to incorporate add-ins further on that will
                              add to the game line as a whole and take it in newer directions. It is, after all, a flexible game system.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>So we've compiled a huge quantity of textual content. Now we're working to massage this content, bringing our own touch to
                              the game, and incorporating the feedback and comments from a number of people who have been actively involved with the game
                              since it's release. Once we're past this phase, we will move the drafts out to the playtesters. Their job is extremely valuable,
                              and I suspect some of them may not be aware of how hard they are going to be pushed for feedback and comments.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>I'm still not sure what sort of commentary you would all like me to post on these blogs, so please do take the time to leave
                              me some comments. Otherwise, I'll cut this short and blog on another time. A parting comment: currently, the Player's Compendium
                              draft is 386 pages without graphics or an index. We projected a book probably around 450 pages, so this is looking to be the
                              case. Back to the keyboard!

                        </div>
                        <div>How did I get into this Earthdawn thing? Well, I've been a Gamemaster since I was 11; started off with boxed Dungeons and
                           Dragons and then moved to Chivalry and Sorcery, DragonQuest, Tunnels and Trolls, RuneQuest -- the usual suspects, other than
                           Dungeons and Dragons. Being a player was (and still is) a rare thing, although I did pick up an award for top player in a
                           convention in the '80s. Nostalgic memory there... *smile*
                           
                           
                           <p>On to Earthdawn. This game I discovered on its release. One of the few shops stocking roleplaying games in New Zealand had
                              a copy, plus the Barsaive boxed set and Mists of Betrayal. I paid the money, and got an addiction in return. Looking back,
                              I'm not sure what it was about the game that appealed so much. I mean, personally, I had GM'd so many games over the years
                              that the prospect of another was, well, no big deal. But I read the core rulebook and was hooked.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>You see, for me, I've always wanted to run a game that allowed flexibility in every area I wanted to run in: horror, politics,
                              dungeon crawls, big sweeping vistas -- the "Gone With The Wind" of roleplaying games.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Don't get me wrong: there are a lot of games that can claim this crown. But I wanted something that "made sense" (to me, anyway)
                              and that's where the ED game appealed. Was Earthdawn, the game, designed from the outset to illicit this sort of emotion?
                              I suspect not. But it did. And it stuck. And I took the time out to introduce my players to it, and they liked it, and it
                              stuck with them. So much so, in fact, that it is now (officially) the longest running campaign we have run to date.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Anyway, rant mode aside, on to how this became the focus of RedBrick. Richard Vowles (my business partner and occasional conscience
                              *grin*) attended a convention at which I ran a series of Earthdawn games: nothing major, just a trio of sessions that effectively
                              formed a "contiguous ED session." But I must have struck a nerve (probably that near encounter with the wormskull), because
                              he was impressed enough to start collecting ED books -- everything Richard could get his hands on, including one of my spare
                              sets of books -- and then came up with the idea of approaching Wizkids (who had the rights at the time) for an ED license.
                              I confess I laughed at the idea. Although I had been running my own Jamesdawn "House Rules" variant for a while, the idea
                              of actually getting a license seemed, well, kinda far-fetched, to be honest. Boy, was I surprised when Wizkids came back with
                              a "show us what you are proposing" response. At this point things started getting a little more serious...
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>I don't know how you all approach life, the universe and everything (sic), but I have some clear goals in my life. One of
                              these has always been to turn my hobby into a career. Like many people, I have entertained the idea of becoming the "next
                              big thing" in writing -- churning out novels at a frenetic pace, and having publishers approach me in droves, all vying for
                              my business and attention. However, being a Cancerian, and therefore somewhat  (yeah, right!) conservative in my approach
                              to things, the likelihood of this happening was, well, remote; maybe until I had retired, anyway. I digress...
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>So, Richard had pushed the button, Wizkids had answered, and we needed to consider whether we were seriously going to pursue
                              this license. Richard asked me what I thought. I thought a lot about it (as one should). And my first thought was, "OK. Yes.
                              Why not?" So that's where we started. More on this later...

                           <p>I guess the purpose of these entries is several-fold:</p>
                           
                           <p>1) To keep you all in touch with what's happening as we develop (or redevelop) various products for Earthdawn.</p>
                           
                           <p>2) To provide a means for me to post in just one place, thus centralizing "things" and hopefully avoid "forum-skipping" --
                              that's where I visit all the forums I can and post bits and pieces all over the Web.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>3) Giving you an insight into who I am, how I think, how I work, what non-Earthdawn or un-RedBrick stuff I'm doing, other
                              personal stuff; that sort of thing.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>With that in mind, I'll do my best to keep up regular postings here. If there's anything you want to direct to my attention,
