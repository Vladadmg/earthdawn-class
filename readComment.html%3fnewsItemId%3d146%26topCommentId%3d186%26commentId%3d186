<br>
<p>I have a different opinion about the published materials--I have always looked at Earthdawn guides not as rules supplements, but as mood and concept supplements.  Guides like _The Ork Nation of Cara Fahd_ and _BLood Wood_ were great because they revealed the secrets of those lands--not because they gave me new rules to use in my next campaign.<p></p>This doesn't mean that I always agreed with everything that they have written, but have you agreed with every book put out by Wizards of the Coast or Steve Jackson Games?  If you don't want but 5% of the material, find one of the 50 people you've met and photocopy it!  Don't keep me from gathering ideas for adventures in Skypoint or Throal, just because you think that 95% of the book was lousy.<p></p>Here's a tip--read sourcebooks like novels or history text, not straight supplemental materials.</p>

<br>30 October 2003</font></td><td width="80%"><font><b>So what went wrong with the original Earthdawn?</b>
<br>
<p>I have played ED since 1995 and I daresay I have bought, borrowed or read every single ED book that has ever been published, including some of the more obscure net project books. <p></p>Now, the first thing that sprung to my mind, was that I only ever (during 7 years of intense GMing and playing in a number of highly diversed ED campaigns) seemed to encounter/use about 2% of the material from all the books. <p></p>I was simply overwhelmed by the vast amount of bad writing, unrealized storylines, failed plots, un-epic epicness and worst of all, the wonderfully inane "mythos" of the whole ED universe. I love ED, I really do, but I think that what killed it was the amount of crap that was published, in a manner that totally diluted the value of the core world. From what I first new about Barsaive in the world section of the 1st ED rule book, to all the completely unnecessary stuff that was published after awhile. <p></p>Who ever used the weird legends in ED Legends? Who ever forced their players to memorize all the adept meta-mythos in the Adepts way? Who ever used 5% of the horrors featured in the books? Who could ever play a single adventure without major rewriting of the plot?<p></p>I recognize the idea behind it all: to publish and provide to players a vast amount of material to choose from and so build their own campaigns out of this material. But in reality it just served to dilute the ED brand and confused players as to wich book was ever worth buying. Inevitably every book contained a gem, but who wants to fork out a considerable amount of cash for all the nonsense that followed in the books? Now, I have only met about 40-50 different ED players, but many seemed to share my feelings.<p></p>Too much material, not enough quality. Too few gems, too far spread out. <p></p>So when I saw the publishing list today my jaw dropped. "oh no, they are doing it again."<p></p>If I can't appeal to your taste, I should at least be able to appeal to your sense of economics - who will buy these sourcebooks, the total being worth something like a smaller car? Is there truly a market for it? Is it all really that good? Is all the material really useful? Publish new books with a concentrated material instead of just rehashing the old stuff. Give us the cream, and write new stuff to replace the 95% junk ratio of before. You have the power to do this! <p></p>And one thing that always bothered me in ED, if the world was supposed to be an ancient version of our own, why are all the rivers, coastlines and continents EXACTLY parallel to todays Earth? Why not to the earth of 25 000 years ago? It would make more sense...<p></p>Sorry about my crappy English. I'm not a native speaker, but who is in this day and age? :)<p></p>Robert</p>

<br>
<p>Hey Robert,<p></p>I'm kind of agreeing with most of your points, and to name a few...<br>- The Adepts book: 4/5 blablabla, 1/5 useful material.<br>- The races books: could easily be in a single book.<br>- Dragons and horrors, again two books (if the first could come out one day) that could be easily joined together.  We need information, but these beings are so powerful that you don't care if there are 50 or 100 of them.  10 of each, plus minions are enough, for each sides.<p></p>On the other and although you are right about advantures, I believe we need them for ideas, not just for simply playing them because they have to fit with your PCs.  That's why I liked the idea that FASA was using at one point with ShadowRun, or how Living Room Game made their first ever adventure book: the adventures are written as guidelines.  The GM decides the encounters, the level of difficulty, the legend awards, etc.<p></p>Look at it this way, it saves up some space for other material in the same book, like another adventure, or even additional game material.<p></p>Lastly and personaly, I simply just love the ED rules, but not the world.  That's why my group decided to use another world instead, a great world accompanied by lousy/crappy game rules, Dark Sun from AD&amp;D.<p></p>We've been at it since 1995, removing some ED stuff (sorry, no orks, trolls, etc.), adding more (like half-giants, muls, etc.), and changing some (the sky raider is now a desert raider and the air sailor a silt sailor).<p></p>Bottom line, and to quote you, "Too much material, not enough quality. Too few gems, too far spread out."<p></p>My two cents.<p></p>Pat B</p>

<br>
<p>Why not to the earth of 25 000 years ago? It would make more sense...<p></p>I have to address this part.<p></p>The Earth of Earthdawn is the Earth of approximately 5000 years ago (3113 BC marks the end of the 4th world).  FASA put this forth in a short story in the Shadowrun setting by Tom Dowd (<a target="_blank" href="">Humans &amp; the Cycle of Magic</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.srrpg.com/fiction/fiction1.shtml">Humans &amp; the Cycle of Magic</a> on the official SR Webpage).<p></p>Geologically speaking, not much is new in the world.  There's no reason to have them be much different.  Sure, rivers would have changed with erosion, same with the coastlines.  But still, not much.  The coastlines have always fit together, that's where the theory of continental drift came from.<p></p>Sorry, that geology degree comes peeking out from time to time.<p></p>Lady Saria<br>http://www.ladysaria.com</p>

<p>Hi all,<p></p>The Compendiums on the roster are intended to be a compilation of the majority of the rules material (read: as much as can be put into them) from the many published supplements and sourcebooks. Unless there's a huge move for it, we're not simply reprinting the old supplements. If you think of the Compendiums as a consolidation exercise, then you will be closer to the mark.<p></p>As for combining other supplements? Absolutely. Denizens 1 and 2 are in the pipeline for that treatment. Dragons and Horrors will likely make their way into the Gamemasters Compendium -- again, a consolidation exercise.<p></p>Why do this? Because on the roster you will also see (and I'm surprised no-one has commented on this) a generic category called Earthdawn Worlds. And this is for non-Barsaive, non-Fourth World Earthdawn supplements.<p></p>We don't have any firm plans in this space yet. If someone has some good ideas then we would be happy to discuss them, but it is there as an option.<p></p>As for use and quality of FASA supplements. I'm not going to debate that here. Opinions are welcomed as to quality and usefulness, but I as I have posted on other forums, I would rather see posters expressing their opinions with some facts and examples if at all possible. That not only adds credibility to one's opinions, but also helps us out by better understanding what the market actually wants.<p></p>If there are products that you would like to see that are not listed, then please LET US KNOW! RedBrick is very happy to entertain new ideas and directions for Earthdawn. If there are products that, historically, you have had quality issues or concerns about, please LET US KNOW! That will help us by ensuring that we don't fall into the same pit with our revised and original products.<p></p>And lastly, thank you for your candid feedback. It is noted and appreciated. We want to see Earthdawn do well in the marketplace. That means producing products that are received and sell well. That can only be done by understanding what our customers want. And your feedback helps us do that...<p></p>Kind regards,<p></p>JAMES FLOWERS<br>Line Developer, RedBrick Limited</p>

<p>WOW. I cannot disagree more.  I think the setting is the heart and soul of ED. Without it, its just another in a long line of generic fantasy systems.  I'll agree some of the adventures were lacking, but other then that I greatly enjoy almost all of the metaplot and setting.</p>

<p>Speaking as someone who's played ED for most of the time it's been out, and who plays with people who loved ED from Day One, I have to strongly disagree with you...<p></p>The game designers cleared stated in the rules, and I'm paraphrasing, "take the world and make it your own. The rules are a guide..."<p></p>For a game that takes place 5-7,000 years before our own, the amount of reverse extrapolation that had to take place was enourmous, and all hangs together reasonably well. An "inane mythos"? Does that take into account the disparate viewpoints of the Theran Noble, to the Blood Warder, to the Crystal Raider, to the Urupan-born Illusionist that each live in the ED world and have experienced it in their own way? <p></p>The ED Legends book was a great way to get the flavor of the world, and ideas on how to make magic items, write ED style, and what the whole idea is behind "legend". I was never forced to memorize anything out of Adept's Way, but one of my favorite characters came from some of the flavor text and additional rules in the book (an Explorer Scout). A character I'm running now that is the son of a character I played for 8 years also grew from ideas that came in reading that sourcebook.<p></p>Did I like everything in the Theran Sourcebook? No, I thought the whole Talean section was poo, but I liked the book overall. The Cara Fahd and Crystal Raider sourcebooks were invaluable, front to back, for playing in entire campagins I participated in, from local flavor to scenario ideas, to character concepts.<p></p>I wouldn't want to go against more than 5% of the Horrors in the FASA Horrors book. To this day that book gives me the creeps, because of how it's written and what it implies in the ED world of the Horrors. And the few Horrors from that book the GMs ran us against in a proper fashion (no Verjigorm-is-my-bitach silliness here) were thought provoking, character threatening role-playing experiences.<p></p>If you have to re-write the plot in a module to fit your campaign, so what? I'd rather do that then read verbatim out of a book just to run something...and customizing adventures for players is the sign of the GM who's got their buunda together...<p></p>Perhaps FASA dropped plots or had some continuity errors...on the whole, one can find all manner of gems in the bulk of the ED material, from metaplot to game flavor to character concepts to adventure hooks. All ya have to do is look.<p></p>Where I think ED went wrong, originally, is when the folks at FASA dropped it in favor of Vor, Crimson Skies, and Crucible. That left lots of material unpublished, and many gamers in the lurch until LRG came along to pick up ED again. And now RedBrick is here to pick up the pieces again, AGAIN...<p></p>Now is the opportunity, where Redbrick is holding out a seat to gamers to contribute to the ED game world, if you want to. Ultimately, we gamers COLLECT the gaming material to play in a game world. If you're not interested in buying, and don't think it's worth playing...why be involved at all? If it's all about economics, would you really be a gamer? Would you ever take a chance on a new game system without a guaranteed positive ROI? <p></p>To me, that's not gaming, it's just bean counting. Now is the time to participate and add to the ED world.</p>

<br>
<p>I've used many of the legends in ED: Legends of Barsaive and the Book of Exploration. Mind you, I wrote four of the BofE legends, so of course I've used my own material in gaming. <p></p>To me, the legends, the backstory, the flavor text, is what sets ED apart from other game systems. There's more depth of culture, more flavor to the gameworld, and more possibilities in actually playing the role of your character. I strongly dislike games that bring out rules supplement after rules supplement, not naming Names as that would be impolitic. For a roleplaying game, I want the emphasis to be on roleplaying, and that requires background information. The Denizens books are some of my favorite gaming material of all time. They add so much depth to the Name-giver races that I'm hard pressed to think of a supplement that has enhanced my game more, except maybe Robin Laws' masterpiece, Throal. <p></p>I have to ask you this: If you find the writing and line development so distasteful, why do you have anything to do with Earthdawn in the first place? Perhaps there are other game systems that would appeal more to your preferences.</p>
